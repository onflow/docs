# Flow Developer Documentation

> Flow is the DeFi blockchain: a high-performance layer-one blockchain designed for automated DeFi and large-scale onchain applications.
>
> Flow's multi-role architecture isolates heavy computation to Execution Nodes while keeping validation lightweight, so developers gain incredible performance and users benefit from low-cost transactions even at scale.
>
> The Forte upgrade expands the core protocol with Flow Actions for atomic multi-step DeFi operations and Scheduled Transactions for fully on-chain automation. Developers can compose swaps, staking, or yield workflows that self-execute without off-chain keepers, scripts, or relayers required.
>
> Flow supports two smart contract languages:
>
> **Cadence** provides native resource safety, 128-bit fixed-point arithmetic for financial precision, built-in WebAuthn authentication for secure, seedless user onboarding, and vastly increased contract size, storage, and computation limits. It also grants native data availability, and Cadence transactions are written in the language itself, which allows for multiple calls to multiple functions on multiple smart contracts all with a single user signature.
>
> **Solidity** allows developers to deploy existing contracts on a fast and efficient, fully EVM-equivalent network while benefitting from access to native VRF, batched transactions, and all the benefits of the Flow protocol. A native bridge allows seamless transfers of assets between these two VMs.
>
> Flow delivers a unified environment for automation-heavy, composable applications that demand reliability and precision at scale. It's where DeFi, fintech, and consumer-grade performance converge in a single L1.
>
> **The Forte Upgrade**: Until now, blockchains have largely been reactive, responding only when a user or off-chain keeper sends a transaction. Forte changes that model by giving developers a native framework for composable, autonomous execution. With Flow Actions, builders can link together standardized DeFi primitives such as sources, sinks, swappers, price oracles, and flashers into atomic, protocol-agnostic workflows. A single transaction can claim rewards, swap assets, add liquidity, and restake LP tokens without any off-chain orchestration.
>
> Complementing this composability, Scheduled Transactions introduce the first truly on-chain time scheduler. Developers can schedule or trigger transactions directly within Flow accounts, enabling recurring actions, deferred settlements, and autonomous portfolio management without external cron jobs or trusted servers. Together, Actions and Scheduling allow DeFi protocols to become self-maintaining: positions can compound automatically, vaults can adjust exposure based on time or events, and protocols can enforce predictable behavior entirely on-chain.
>
> Flow is also home to major consumer applications like NBA Top Shot, CryptoKitties, and numerous NFT marketplaces, demonstrating its versatility for both DeFi and consumer-grade performance at scale.
