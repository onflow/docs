title: Get Started with Account Linking
---

There are two sides to Hybrid Custody support - delegation and usage. 

On the delegation side, we have the apps that leverage Hybrid Custody for enhanced UX. This side primarily concerns itself with walletless onboarding + account linking (IOW account delegation). You can think of a Hybrid Custody game client or project-specific NFT app.

From the usage perspective, apps would want to get information about a user's linked accounts to display accounts & assets, enable account & asset management, and even facilitate cross account interactions - think of this from the perspective of a wallet or NFT marketplace.

In either case, you'll want to do the following to get started implementing Hybrid Custody in your application:

1. Set up your environment
1. Copy the contents of [linked-accounts](https://github.com/onflow/linked-accounts) into your project
1. ???
1. Profit
