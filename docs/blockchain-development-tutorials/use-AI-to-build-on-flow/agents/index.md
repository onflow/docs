# AI Agents

AI agents represent the next evolution in blockchain interaction, combining artificial intelligence with blockchain capabilities to create autonomous systems that can execute complex tasks, interact with smart contracts, and automate workflows. This section explores how to build intelligent agents that leverage Flow's unique features to create powerful, self-directing blockchain applications.

Unlike traditional chatbots or simple AI assistants, blockchain AI agents can autonomously execute transactions, manage digital assets, interact with DeFi protocols, and coordinate complex multi-step operations across the Flow ecosystem. These agents bridge the gap between AI decision-making and blockchain execution, enabling new forms of automated financial services, gaming mechanics, and decentralized applications.

## [Eliza on Flow]

Learn how to build conversational AI agents on Flow using Eliza, a framework for creating intelligent agents that interact through natural language. Set up agents with customizable personalities, integrate multiple AI models, and connect to Flow's blockchain infrastructure.

### [Eliza Plugin Development Guide]

Extend your Eliza agents with custom plugins for specialized functionality. Create plugin repositories, implement custom actions, and publish to the Eliza Plugin Registry for community sharing.

## [Build Custom AI Agents on Flow with AgentKit]

Create autonomous AI agents that interact with Flow's blockchain using AgentKit. Set up agents on Flow's EVM-compatible environment, integrate AI models like Claude and GPT-4, and deploy systems that execute blockchain transactions automatically.

## Key Benefits of AI Agents on Flow

**Autonomous Execution**: Agents can independently execute complex blockchain operations without human intervention, from simple token transfers to sophisticated DeFi strategies.

**Flow-Native Integration**: Leverage Flow's unique multi-role architecture, built-in randomness, and efficient transaction processing for enhanced agent capabilities.

**EVM Compatibility**: Build agents that work seamlessly with both Flow's native Cadence environment and EVM-compatible tools and frameworks.

**Intelligent Decision Making**: Combine AI reasoning with real-time blockchain data to make informed decisions about transactions, asset management, and protocol interactions.

**Scalable Automation**: Create agents that can manage multiple wallets, coordinate complex workflows, and scale operations across the Flow ecosystem.

## Use Cases for AI Agents

**Conversational Interfaces**: Build Eliza-powered agents that can provide natural language interfaces to Flow applications, helping users navigate complex DeFi protocols or gaming mechanics through conversation.

**Automated Trading**: Build agents that can analyze market conditions, execute trades, and manage portfolios across Flow's DeFi ecosystem while communicating decisions to users.

**Gaming Automation**: Create intelligent NPCs or automated players that can interact with Flow-based games, manage in-game assets, and execute complex game mechanics with personality-driven responses.

**Portfolio Management**: Develop agents that can automatically rebalance portfolios, compound yields, and optimize asset allocation based on market conditions while providing conversational feedback.

**Protocol Automation**: Build agents that can interact with complex DeFi protocols, execute arbitrage opportunities, and manage liquidity positions with intelligent decision-making capabilities.

**Asset Management**: Create agents that can automatically mint, transfer, and manage NFTs based on predefined conditions or AI-driven decisions, with customizable personalities and interaction styles.

## Conclusion

AI agents combine artificial intelligence with blockchain capabilities to create autonomous systems on Flow. Whether building conversational agents with Eliza or autonomous systems with AgentKit, these tutorials provide the foundation for creating intelligent blockchain applications that can execute transactions, engage users, and automate complex workflows across the Flow ecosystem.
