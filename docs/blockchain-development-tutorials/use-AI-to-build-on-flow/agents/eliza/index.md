# Quickstart Guide to build AI Agent on Flow with Eliza

## Overview

Eliza is a powerful framework for building AI agents that can interact with users through natural language. This tutorial will guide you through how to set up and deploy an AI agent on the Flow blockchain with Eliza. You'll learn how to create intelligent agents that can understand and respond to user queries, while leveraging Flow's secure and scalable infrastructure.

## Learning Objectives

After you complete this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Set up the Eliza development environment.
- Configure and deploy an AI agent on Flow.
- Create and customize character configurations.
- Integrate different AI models with your agent.
- Interact with your AI agent through a web interface.
- Add and develop custom plugins for extended functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started started with Eliza, make sure you have:

- [Node.js 23+] (using [nvm] is recommended)
- [pnpm 9+]
- Git for version control
- A code editor ([VS Code], [Cursor] or [VSCodium] recommended)
- [Flow-cli] for Flow blockchain interaction.

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2] is required.

## Installation

ElizaOnFlow is a Flow-dedicated Eliza wrapper, so:

- The plugins from this repository are also compatible with the origin [Eliza].
- You can also use any plugins from original Eliza in this repository.

Clone the repository

```bash
# The ElizaOnFlow is a wrapper with origin Eliza as submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/onflow/elizaOnFlow.git

# Enter directory
cd elizaOnFlow

# Please checkout the main branch which is using the latest release of origin Eliza
git checkout main
```

Or, If you want to use the origin Eliza, run:

```bash
# Eliza's characters folder is a submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/elizaOs/eliza.git

# Enter directory
cd eliza

# Checkout the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

If you already cloned without submodules, run:

```bash
# Fetch submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

:::warning

Only use the `--no-frozen-lockfile` option when you're initially instantiating the repo or bump the version of a package or add a new package to your `package.json` file. This practice helps maintain consistency in your project's dependencies and prevents unintended changes to the lockfile.

:::

If you use ElizaOnFlow, you need to install Flow Cadence contracts dependencies to ensure that the Cadence extension correctly lints `*.cdc`.

Install Flow Cadence contracts dependencies:

```bash
flow deps install
```

Build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the appropriate values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

:::danger

In normal development, it's a best practice to use a `.env` to protect API keys and other sensitive information. When you work with crypto, it's **critical** to always use them, even in test projects or tutorials. If you expose a wallet key, you might lose everything in that wallet immediately, or someone might watch it for years and rob you the day you put something valuable there.

:::

Edit `.env` and add your values. Do **NOT** add this file to version control.

### Choose Your Model

Eliza supports multiple AI models and you set which model to use inside the character JSON file.
But remember, after you chosed a model, you need to set up the relevant configuration.

Check the full list of supported LLMs in origin Eliza: [Models.ts]

Suggested models:

- Use API to access LLM providers:
  - OpenAI: set modelProvider as `openai`, and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`.
  - Deepseek: set modelProvider as `deepseek`, and set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `.env`.
  - Grok: set modelProvider as `grok`, and set `GROK_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- Use local inference
  - Ollama: set modelProvider as `ollama`, and set `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `.env` to the model name you use in ollama.

> To choose a model, you need to set in charactor configuration. For example: OPENAI, set `modelProvider: "openai"` in charactor JSON file or `modelProvider: ModelProviderName.OPENAI` in `charactor.ts`

### Setup Agent's Flow Account

Create a new Flow account for the Agent. Learn more: [doc]

```bash
flow accounts create
```

> If you use Testnet, you can get free tokens from [Flow Faucet]

Set the Flow blockchain configuration in `.env` with a newly-generated Flow account.

```bash
FLOW_ADDRESS=
FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY=
FLOW_NETWORK=       # Default: mainnet
FLOW_ENDPOINT_URL=  # Default: <https://mainnet.onflow.org>
```

For testnet, check Flow's [Networks] for more information.

## Create Your First Agent

### Create a Character File

View the `deps/eliza/characters/` directory for a number of character files to try out.
Additionally, you can edit `charactor.ts` to override Eliza's `defaultCharacter` file, which is the default character file used if no character json files are provided.

Copy one of the example character files and make it your own:

```bash
cp characters/scooby.character.json characters/sample.character.json
```

üìù [Character Documentation]

### **Start the Agent**

Tell it which character you want to run:

```bash
pnpm start --character="characters/sample.character.json"
```

Or, you can use `pnpm start:debug` for more debugging logs:

```bash
pnpm start:debug --character="characters/sample.character.json"
```

You can load multiple characters with a comma-separated list:

```bash
pnpm start --characters="characters/sample.character.json, characters/scooby.character.json"
```

### Add / Develop Plugins

Run `npx elizaos plugins list` to get a list of available plugins or visit [Eliza Plugins Registry]

Run `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-NAME` to install the plugin into your instance

To create a new plugin **for your own business**, refer to the [plugin development guide].

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, install it with the following command:

```bash
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```

### **Interact with the Agent**

Now you're ready to start a conversation with your agent.

Open a new terminal window and run the client's http server.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

After the client is running, you'll see a message like this:

```bash
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Click the link or open your browser to `http://localhost:5173/`. You'll see the chat interface connect to the system, and you can now interact with your character.
