# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development by providing intelligent assistance, code generation, and comprehensive knowledge access. You will learn how to enhance your Flow development experience by using these LLMs. Each tutorial demonstrates how to configure specialized AI assistants that understand Flow's unique features, Cadence smart contract development, and the broader Flow ecosystem.

## [Use Flow Knowledge Base in ChatGPT]

Learn how to create a Custom GPT using ChatGPT that can reference Flow's comprehensive documentation to answer development questions. This guide walks you through setting up FlowGPT with OpenAI's platform, configuring it with Flow Data Sources, and optimizing it for Cadence smart contract development. The tutorial covers the complete GPT creation process, from initial setup through testing and deployment, allowing you to have an AI assistant that understands Flow's architecture, tools, and best practices.

## [Use Flow Knowledge Base in Gemini AI]

Discover how to build a Custom GEM using Google's Gemini AI platform that specializes in Flow blockchain development. This tutorial demonstrates how to configure Gemini AI with Flow's documentation as its primary knowledge source, which creates an assistant that can provide practical guidance on Cadence programming, Flow CLI usage, and ecosystem integration. Learn how to set up FlowGem with proper instructions, knowledge base integration, and testing protocols to ensure accurate and helpful responses for your development workflow.

## [Claude Code for Flow Development]

Master the comprehensive development approach using Claude Code (Claude) for Flow blockchain applications. This extensive guide covers the four-stage development methodology (Idea → Visualization → Planning → Build), advanced features like subagents and auto-verification, and systematic deployment strategies. Learn how to configure persistent project context through `CLAUDE.md` files, implement checkpoint-based development workflows, and leverage Claude's unlimited context windows for complex Cadence smart contract projects and cross-VM applications.
