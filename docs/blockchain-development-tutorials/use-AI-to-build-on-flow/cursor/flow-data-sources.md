- **Development Tools**: Provide context-aware assistance in IDEs like Cursor

## Integration with AI Tools

Flow Data Sources is specifically designed to work seamlessly with various AI development tools:

### [Cursor Integration]

Add Flow Data Sources to your Cursor documentation by referencing the GitHub URL directly. This provides your AI assistant with up-to-date Flow knowledge. 

### [ChatGPT Custom GPTs]

Upload the merged documentation files to create specialized Flow development assistants that can answer complex questions about Cadence, Flow CLI, and ecosystem tools.

### [Claude Code Integration]

Reference Flow Data Sources in your CLAUDE.md files to ensure persistent, comprehensive Flow knowledge across all development sessions.


## Key Benefits

**Always Current**: Automatically updated to reflect the latest Flow ecosystem changes and documentation updates.

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes documentation from all major Flow development tools and resources in one place.

**AI-Optimized Format**: Structured specifically for optimal AI processing and accurate response generation.

**Multiple Formats**: Different file sizes to accommodate various system requirements and use cases.

**Community Driven**: Benefits from contributions across the entire Flow developer ecosystem.

## Best Practices

**Choose the Right File**: Use `all_merged.md` for comprehensive coverage or `essentials_merged.md` for lighter integration.

**Regular Updates**: Since the files are continuously updated, refresh your AI tool's knowledge base periodically.

**Combine with Live Docs**: Use Flow Data Sources alongside live documentation links for the most complete development assistance.

**Verify Critical Information**: While highly accurate, always verify critical implementation details against official sources.

## Accessing the Content

The merged documentation files are available at:

- [All Merged Content](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Data-Sources/blob/main/merged_docs/all_merged.md)
- [Essentials Only](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Data-Sources/blob/main/merged_docs/essentials_merged.md)
- [Cadence Only](https://github.com/onflow/Flow-Data-Sources/blob/main/merged_docs/cadence_docs_merged.md)

For integration with AI tools like Cursor or ChatGPT, use the appropriate URL as described in the respective tutorials.

## Getting Started
