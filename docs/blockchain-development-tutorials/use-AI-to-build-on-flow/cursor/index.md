# Use Flow Knowledge Base in Cursor

[Cursor] is an AI code editor that makes it easy to write code while building Flow apps. This section provides comprehensive guidance on setting up and using Cursor with Flow's extensive documentation ecosystem to enhance your development experience.

## Overview

To get the most out of Cursor for Flow development, you'll need to understand three key components:

1. **Flow Data Sources** - The comprehensive knowledge base that powers AI assistance
2. **Documentation Indexing** - The process of making Flow documentation available within Cursor
3. **Cadence Rules** - Persistent AI context that provides specialized Flow development guidance

## [Flow Data Sources]

Learn about Flow's comprehensive, auto-generated documentation repository that serves as the foundation for AI-assisted development. This resource contains the most current information about Flow, Cadence, and the broader ecosystem, specifically formatted for optimal AI integration.

The Flow Data Sources guide covers:
- What Flow Data Sources contains and how it's organized
- Different file formats available for various use cases
- Integration strategies with AI tools
- Best practices for leveraging this knowledge base

## [Indexing Flow Documentation in Cursor]

Follow the step-by-step process for setting up Flow documentation within Cursor's AI system. This detailed guide walks you through indexing multiple documentation sources to create a comprehensive Flow development environment.

The indexing documentation covers:
- Adding Flow developer documentation to Cursor
- Integrating Cadence language documentation  
- Including Flow Data Sources for comprehensive coverage
- Troubleshooting common indexing issues
- Best practices for using indexed documentation

## [Cadence Rules]

Learn how to use Cursor Rules to enhance AI assistance for Cadence and Flow development with persistent context and automated workflows. This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to create specialized rules that transform your AI assistant into a Flow development expert with continuous knowledge of syntax patterns, NFT standards, and project workflows.

The Cadence Rules guide covers:
- Understanding Cursor Rules and how they provide persistent AI context
- Five specialized rules for Flow development: NFT standards, syntax patterns, development workflows, project configuration, and user preferences  
- Creating custom rules for your specific Flow development needs
- Best practices for rule organization and team collaboration
- Integration with existing Flow development tools and documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Start with Flow Data Sources**: Understand what documentation is available and how it can enhance your development workflow
2. **Follow the Indexing Guide**: Set up your Cursor environment with comprehensive Flow documentation
3. **Configure Cadence Rules**: Implement persistent AI context for consistent Flow development assistance
4. **Practice with Examples**: Use the indexed documentation and rules to build Flow applications with enhanced AI assistance

## Best Practices for Cursor + Flow

- **Use Specific References**: Target `@Flow`, `@Cadence`, or `@Flow Data Sources` based on your needs
- **Leverage Cursor Rules**: Apply `@cadence-nft-standards`, `@cadence-syntax-patterns`, or other specialized rules for consistent guidance
- **Combine Sources**: Leverage multiple documentation sources and rules for comprehensive assistance
- **Verify AI Output**: Cross-reference generated code with official documentation
- **Stay Updated**: Refresh your documentation indexes and rules periodically for current information

This integrated approach combining comprehensive documentation indexing with persistent AI context through Cursor Rules provides you with consistent, accurate, and specialized assistance throughout your Flow development process.
