# EVM Guides

Flow EVM provides full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, enabling developers to deploy existing Solidity contracts and use familiar Ethereum development tools on Flow's high-performance blockchain. These guides demonstrate how to leverage popular Ethereum tools and frameworks to build, test, and deploy smart contracts on Flow EVM while taking advantage of Flow's unique features like built-in randomness and efficient transaction processing.

## [Setup]

Essential setup guides for Flow EVM development, including MetaMask integration and wallet configuration. Learn how to connect popular Ethereum tools to Flow's EVM-compatible network and prepare your development environment for building on Flow.

## [Frameworks]

Modern JavaScript and React frameworks for building Flow EVM applications. These guides cover popular blockchain libraries like ethers.js, web3.js, wagmi, and RainbowKit, providing practical implementation patterns for frontend development on Flow.

## [Development Tools]

Professional Solidity development tools adapted for Flow EVM. Master Foundry's testing suite, Hardhat's TypeScript environment, and Remix's browser-based IDE for comprehensive smart contract development workflows on Flow.

## [Build a Fully-Onchain Image Gallery]

Create a decentralized image gallery that stores images directly on the blockchain using Flow's efficient gas pricing. This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates building smart contracts for onchain image storage, implementing factory patterns for user galleries, and creating a modern React frontend with wallet integration. Learn how Flow's low gas costs enable applications that would be prohibitively expensive on other chains.

## Conclusion

These EVM guides provide comprehensive coverage of the most popular Ethereum development tools and frameworks, adapted for Flow EVM development. Whether you're migrating existing Ethereum applications or building new projects, these tutorials offer practical implementation patterns for wallet integration, contract deployment, and blockchain interaction on Flow's high-performance EVM-compatible network.
