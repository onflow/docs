# Flow EVM Guides

Flow EVM provides full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which allows developers to deploy current Solidity contracts and use familiar Ethereum development tools on Flow's high-performance blockchain. These guides demonstrate how to leverage popular Ethereum tools and frameworks to build, test, and deploy smart contracts on Flow EVM while taking advantage of Flow's unique features like built-in randomness and efficient transaction processing.

## [Setup]

Essential setup guides for Flow EVM development, which includes MetaMask integration and wallet configuration. Learn how to connect popular Ethereum tools to Flow's EVM-compatible network and prepare your development environment to build on Flow.

## [Frameworks]

Modern JavaScript and React frameworks to build Flow EVM applications. These guides cover popular blockchain libraries like `ethers.js`, `web3.js`, `wagmi`, and RainbowKit. They provide practical implementation patterns for frontend development on Flow.

## [Development Tools]

Professional Solidity development tools adapted for Flow EVM. Master Foundry's testing suite, Hardhat's TypeScript environment, and Remix's browser-based IDE for comprehensive smart contract development workflows on Flow.

## [Build a Fully-Onchain Image Gallery]

Create a decentralized image gallery that stores images directly on the blockchain with Flow's efficient gas pricing. This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to build smart contracts for onchain image storage, implement factory patterns for user galleries, and create a modern React frontend with wallet integration. Learn how Flow's low gas costs allow applications that would be prohibitively expensive on other chains.

## Conclusion

These EVM guides provide comprehensive coverage of the most popular Ethereum development tools and frameworks, adapted for Flow EVM development. Whether you want to migrate Ethereum applications or build new projects, these tutorials offer practical implementation patterns for wallet integration, contract deployment, and blockchain interaction on Flow's high-performance EVM-compatible network.
