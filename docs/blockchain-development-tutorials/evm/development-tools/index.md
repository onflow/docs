# Flow EVM Development Tools

Professional smart contract development requires robust tooling for writing, testing, deploying, and managing Solidity contracts. This section covers the most popular and powerful development tools in the Ethereum ecosystem, adapted for Flow EVM development. From command-line frameworks to browser-based IDEs, these tools provide everything needed for comprehensive smart contract development workflows.

Each tool offers unique strengths: Foundry excels at testing and gas optimization, Hardhat provides extensive plugin ecosystems and TypeScript support, while Remix enables rapid prototyping without local setup. These tutorials demonstrate how to configure and use each tool effectively with Flow EVM, ensuring you can choose the right development environment for your project needs.

## [Foundry]

Master Foundry's powerful suite of development tools for advanced Solidity contract development, testing, and deployment on Flow EVM. This comprehensive guide covers setting up Foundry projects, writing and testing ERC-20 contracts with extensive test coverage, and deploying to Flow networks with proper configuration and verification. Learn to leverage Foundry's forge, cast, and anvil tools for complete development workflows including contract interaction and state management.

## [Hardhat]

Build and deploy Solidity smart contracts on Flow EVM using Hardhat's comprehensive development environment with TypeScript support and extensive plugins. This tutorial walks through complete project setup, network configuration for Flow testnet and mainnet, contract deployment with custom scripts, and contract verification on Flow's block explorer. You'll implement end-to-end workflows for HelloWorld contract development, testing, and deployment using Hardhat's powerful plugin ecosystem.

## [Remix]

Develop and deploy smart contracts directly in the browser using Remix IDE with Flow EVM integration for rapid prototyping and development. This guide demonstrates setting up Remix for Flow development, deploying contracts through MetaMask integration, and interacting with deployed contracts using Remix's built-in debugging and interaction tools. Learn to use Remix for quick contract development, testing, and deployment without requiring local development environment setup.

## Conclusion

These development tool guides provide comprehensive coverage of the most popular Solidity development environments, each optimized for Flow EVM development. Whether you prefer command-line tools like Foundry, comprehensive frameworks like Hardhat, or browser-based development with Remix, these tutorials offer practical workflows for building, testing, and deploying professional smart contracts on Flow's high-performance EVM network.
