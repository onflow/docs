# Flow EVM Frameworks

Modern blockchain development relies on powerful JavaScript and React frameworks that simplify smart contract interactions and provide seamless user experiences. This section covers the most popular frontend frameworks and libraries for building Flow EVM applications, from low-level blockchain interaction libraries to high-level React components for wallet management and user interfaces.

These frameworks enable developers to build sophisticated decentralized applications using familiar JavaScript and React patterns while leveraging Flow's high-performance EVM environment. Whether you're building simple contract interfaces or complex multi-wallet applications, these tutorials provide practical implementation guidance for integrating proven blockchain development frameworks with Flow EVM.

## [Ethers.js]

Discover how to use ethers.js, the most popular JavaScript library for blockchain interactions, to connect with Flow EVM and manage smart contracts. This guide covers provider setup, reading blockchain data, writing transactions with proper signers, and implementing both read-only queries and state-changing operations. Learn to leverage ethers.js's intuitive interface for comprehensive Flow EVM contract interactions.

## [Web3.js]

Master web3.js integration with Flow EVM for comprehensive smart contract development and blockchain interaction capabilities. This tutorial demonstrates initializing web3 instances with Flow endpoints, querying blockchain state, managing accounts with private keys, and executing contract transactions. You'll work through practical examples including a complete Storage contract implementation with read and write operations.

## [Viem & Wagmi]

Build modern React applications on Flow EVM using wagmi and viem with built-in Flow network configurations and React hooks. This comprehensive guide walks through creating Next.js applications with wallet connection capabilities, smart contract interactions using React hooks, and proper error handling for blockchain operations. Learn to implement complete dApps with wagmi's powerful React integration and viem's efficient blockchain interactions.

## [RainbowKit]

Integrate advanced wallet connection experiences into your Flow EVM applications using RainbowKit with custom Flow Wallet support. This tutorial demonstrates creating custom wallet connectors, configuring WalletConnect integration for seamless mobile and desktop connections, and implementing comprehensive wallet onboarding flows. You'll build complete wallet connection interfaces that support Flow Wallet alongside other popular Ethereum wallets.

## Conclusion

These framework guides provide comprehensive coverage of the most popular JavaScript and React tools for Flow EVM development. From low-level blockchain interactions with ethers.js and web3.js to sophisticated React applications with wagmi and RainbowKit, these tutorials offer practical implementation patterns for building modern decentralized applications on Flow's EVM-compatible network.
