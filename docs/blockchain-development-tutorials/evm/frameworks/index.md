# Flow EVM Frameworks

Modern blockchain development relies on powerful JavaScript and React frameworks that simplify smart contract interactions and provide seamless user experiences. This section covers the most popular frontend frameworks and libraries that you can use to build Flow EVM applications, from low-level blockchain interaction libraries to high-level React components for wallet management and user interfaces.

These frameworks allow developers to build sophisticated decentralized applications with familiar JavaScript and React patterns while leveraging Flow's high-performance EVM environment. Whether you want to build simple contract interfaces or complex multi-wallet applications, these tutorials provide practical implementation guidance for you to integrate proven blockchain development frameworks with Flow EVM.

## [Ethers.js]

Discover how to use `ethers.js`, the most popular JavaScript library for blockchain interactions, to connect with Flow EVM and manage smart contracts. This guide covers provider setup, how to read blockchain data, how to write transactions with proper signers, and how to implement both read-only queries and state-changing operations. Learn to leverage ethers.js's intuitive interface for comprehensive Flow EVM contract interactions.

## [Web3.js]

Master `web3.js` integration with Flow EVM for comprehensive smart contract development and blockchain interaction capabilities. This tutorial demonstrates how to initialize web3 instances with Flow endpoints, how to query blockchain state, how to manage accounts with private keys, and how to execute contract transactions. You'll work through practical examples, such as a complete Storage contract implementation with read and write operations.

## [Viem & Wagmi]

Build modern React applications on Flow EVM with wagmi and viem with built-in Flow network configurations and React hooks. This comprehensive guide walks through how to create `Next.js` applications with wallet connection capabilities, smart contract interactions with React hooks, and proper error handling for blockchain operations. Learn to implement complete dApps with wagmi's powerful React integration and viem's efficient blockchain interactions.

## [RainbowKit]

Integrate advanced wallet connection experiences into your Flow EVM applications using RainbowKit with custom Flow Wallet support. This tutorial demonstrates how to create custom wallet connectors, how to configure WalletConnect integration for seamless mobile and desktop connections, and how to implement comprehensive wallet onboarding flows. You'll build complete wallet connection interfaces that support Flow Wallet alongside other popular Ethereum wallets.

## Conclusion

These framework guides provide comprehensive coverage of the most popular JavaScript and React tools for Flow EVM development. From low-level blockchain interactions with ethers.js and web3.js to sophisticated React applications with wagmi and RainbowKit, these tutorials offer practical implementation patterns for you to build modern decentralized applications on Flow's EVM-compatible network.
