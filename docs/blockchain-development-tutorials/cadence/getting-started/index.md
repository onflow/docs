# Getting Started with Cadence

The Cadence is designed for the next generation of apps, games, and digital assets. This comprehensive tutorial series will guide you from setting up your development environment to deploying production-ready applications on Flow's mainnet while a complete Counter application that demonstrates all essential Flow development patterns.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial series, you'll discover how to:

- Set up a complete Flow development environment with CLI tools and local emulator
- Build and deploy smart contracts using Cadence
- Integrate external dependencies and work with Flow's composable ecosystem
- Create transactions and implement comprehensive testing strategies
- Build interactive frontend applications using @onflow/react-sdk
- Deploy applications to testnet and mainnet with production best practices
- Implement monitoring, security, and maintenance for live blockchain applications

## What You'll Build

Throughout these tutorials, you'll build a complete **Counter Application** that demonstrates the core aspects of Flow development:

- **Smart Contracts**: Counter contract with increment/decrement functionality
- **External Dependencies**: Integration with NumberFormatter for enhanced display
- **Frontend Interface**: React-based web application with wallet authentication
- **Production Deployment**: Live application accessible on Flow's public networks

By the end, you'll have a fully functional blockchain application and the skills to build your own Flow projects.

## Environment Setup

Learn how to set up your Flow development environment and deploy your first smart contract. This foundational tutorial covers CLI installation, project creation, contract deployment, and basic blockchain interaction patterns using the local Flow emulator.

Tutorial: [Cadence Environment Setup]

## Smart Contract Interaction

Master advanced Flow development skills including dependency management, sophisticated transaction patterns, and comprehensive testing strategies. Learn to integrate external contracts, handle complex state changes, and implement test-driven development workflows.

Tutorial: [Smart Contract Interaction]

## Building a Frontend App

Create a Next.js frontend application that interacts with your Flow smart contracts using @onflow/react-sdk. Implement wallet authentication, real-time data queries, transaction submission, and status monitoring for a complete user experience.

Tutorial: [Building a Frontend App]

## Production Deployment

Take your application live by deploying to Flow's testnet and mainnet networks. Learn security best practices, production configuration, monitoring strategies, and maintenance practices for managing live blockchain applications.

Tutorial: [Production Deployment]
