# Smart Contract Interaction

Building on your local development setup from the previous tutorial, you'll now master advanced Flow development skills that every professional developer needs. This tutorial focuses on working with external dependencies, building sophisticated transactions, and establishing robust testing practices.

Flow's composability is one of its greatest strengthsâ€”contracts can easily import and use functionality from other contracts. You'll learn to leverage this power while building reliable, well-tested applications that interact seamlessly with the broader Flow ecosystem.

## What You'll Learn

After completing this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- **Manage external dependencies** using Flow's dependency manager and integrate third-party contracts
- **Build sophisticated transactions** that interact with multiple contracts and handle complex state changes
- **Master transaction anatomy** and understand how Cadence transactions work under the hood
- **Implement comprehensive testing** strategies including edge cases and error conditions
- **Apply test-driven development** workflows to ensure code quality and reliability
- **Handle transaction monitoring** and error management in production scenarios

## What You'll Build

Building on your Counter contract, you'll enhance it with external dependencies and create a comprehensive testing suite. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- **Enhanced Counter app** that uses the NumberFormatter contract for better display
- **Complex transactions** that demonstrate advanced interaction patterns
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Professional workflow** for developing, testing, and deploying contract interactions

**Prerequisites:**

- Completed Environment Setup tutorial
- Flow CLI, emulator running, and Counter contract deployed
- Basic understanding of Cadence syntax

## Managing Dependencies

In addition to creating your own contracts, you can also install contracts that have already been deployed to the network by using the [Dependency Manager]. This is useful for interacting with contracts that are part of the Flow ecosystem or that have been deployed by other developers.

Flow's dependency manager allows you to:

- Install contracts deployed on any Flow network (mainnet, testnet, emulator)
- Automatically manage contract addresses across different environments
- Keep your code portable and environment-independent

For example, let's say we want to format the result of our `GetCounter` script so that we display the number with commas if it's greater than 999. To do that we can install a contract called [`NumberFormatter`] from `testnet` that has a function to format numbers.

### Install NumberFormatter Contract

The [`NumberFormatter`] contract provides utilities for formatting numbers with commas, making large numbers more readable. Let's install it from testnet:

```zsh
flow dependencies install testnet://8a4dce54554b225d.NumberFormatter
```

When prompted:

1. **Account to deploy to:** Select `emulator-account` (this will deploy it locally for development)
2. **Alias for mainnet:** You can skip this by pressing Enter

This command:

- Downloads the NumberFormatter contract from testnet and any of its dependencies
- Adds it to your `imports/` directory
- Configures deployment settings in [`flow.json`]
- Sets up automatic address resolution

### Configure Dependencies in flow.json

Open your `flow.json` file and notice the new sections:

```json
{
    .
    .
    .
  "dependencies": {
		"NumberFormatter": {
			"source": "testnet://8a4dce54554b225d.NumberFormatter",
			"hash": "dc7043832da46dbcc8242a53fa95b37f020bc374df42586a62703b2651979fb9",
			"aliases": {
				"testnet": "8a4dce54554b225d"
			}
		}
	},
    .
    .
    .
  "deployments": {
		"emulator": {
			"emulator-account": [
				"NumberFormatter"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

This configuration:

- Maps the `NumberFormatter` dependency to its testnet source
- Sets up deployment to your emulator account
- Enables automatic address resolution in your code

### Deploy External Dependencies

Now we can deploy the `NumberFormatter` contract to the emulator by running:

```zsh
flow project deploy
```

You should see output like:

```zsh
Deploying 1 contracts for accounts: emulator-account

NumberFormatter -> 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 (66e6c4210ae8263370fc3661f148f750175bb4cf2e80637fb42eafe2d6c5b385)

ðŸŽ‰ All contracts deployed successfully
```

### Integrate External Contract

Now let's update your `GetCounter.cdc` script to use the NumberFormatter. Open `cadence/scripts/GetCounter.cdc` and update it:

```cadence
import "Counter"
import "NumberFormatter"

access(all)
fun main(): String {
    // Retrieve the count from the Counter contract
    let count: Int = Counter.getCount()

    // Format the count using NumberFormatter
    let formattedCount = NumberFormatter.formatWithCommas(number: count)

    // Return the formatted count
    return formattedCount
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Import syntax**: `import "Counter"` and `import "NumberFormatter"` don't require addresses
- **Contract interaction**: We call `NumberFormatter.formatWithCommas()` just like any other function
- **Return type change**: The script now returns a `String` instead of an `Int`

### Test the Integration

Run your updated script:

```zsh
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/GetCounter.cdc
```

You should see:

```zsh
Result: "1"
```

The number is now formatted as a string. Let's create a more impressive example by adding a transaction that increments by 1000.

### Create a Bulk Increment Transaction

Generate a new transaction to demonstrate the NumberFormatter's power:

```zsh
flow generate transaction IncrementBy1000
```

Open `cadence/transactions/IncrementBy1000.cdc` and replace the content with:

```cadence
import "Counter"

transaction {
    prepare(acct: &Account) {
        // Authorization handled automatically
    }

    execute {
        // Increment the counter 1000 times
        var i = 0
        while i < 1000 {
            Counter.increment()
            i = i + 1
        }

        // Retrieve the new count and log it
        let newCount = Counter.getCount()
        log("New count after incrementing by 1000: ".concat(newCount.toString()))
    }
}
```

Execute the transaction:

```zsh
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/IncrementBy1000.cdc --signer test-account
```

Now run your formatted script to see the NumberFormatter in action:

```zsh
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/GetCounter.cdc
```

Result:

```zsh
Result: "1,001"
```

Perfect! The NumberFormatter automatically adds commas to make large numbers readable.

**The Power of Composability**: Notice what just happenedâ€”you enhanced your Counter contract's functionality **without modifying the original contract**. This is the power of Flow's composability: you can extend functionality by combining contracts, enabling rapid development and code reuse. Even more importantly, we did this **without needing access or permission.**

## Building Transactions

Transactions are the foundation of blockchain state changes. Unlike scripts (which only read data), transactions can modify contract state, transfer tokens, and emit events. Let's master advanced transaction patterns.

### Understanding Transaction Anatomy

Every Cadence transaction has the same basic structure:

```cadence
import "OtherContract"

transaction {
    // Optional: Declare variables available throughout the transaction
    let initialCount: Int

    // This phase has access to account storage and capabilities
    // Used for authorization and accessing private data
    prepare(acct: &Account) {
    }

    // This phase contains the main transaction logic
    // No access to account storage, only to data from prepare phase
    execute {
    }

    // Optional: Conditions that must be true after execution
    // Used for verification and ensuring transaction success
    post {
    }
}
```

### Transaction Phases Explained

1. **Import Phase**: Declare contract dependencies
2. **Parameter Declaration**: Define inputs the transaction accepts
3. **Variable Declaration**: Declare transaction-scoped variables
4. **Prepare Phase**: Access account storage and capabilities (authorized)
5. **Execute Phase**: Main logic execution (no storage access)
6. **Post Phase**: Verify transaction success conditions

#### Transaction with Parameters

Create a transaction that accepts a custom increment value:

```zsh
flow generate transaction IncrementByAmount
```

Open `cadence/transactions/IncrementByAmount.cdc`:

```cadence
import "Counter"

transaction(amount: Int) {

    // Store initial value
    let initialCount: Int

    prepare(acct: &Account) {
        // Verify the account is authorized to make this change
        log("Account ".concat(acct.address.toString()).concat(" is incrementing by ").concat(amount.toString()))

    prepare(acct: &Account) {
        self.initialCount = Counter.getCount()  // Capture initial state
        log("Account".concat(acct.address.toString()).concat(" is incrementing by").concat(amount.toString()))
    }

    execute {
        // Validate input
        if amount <= 0 {
            panic("Amount must be positive")
        }

        // Increment the specified number of times
        var i = 0
        while i < amount {
            Counter.increment()
            i = i + 1
        }

        let newCount = Counter.getCount()
        log("Counter incremented by ".concat(amount.toString()).concat(", new value: ").concat(newCount.toString()))
    }

    post {
        // Verify the counter increased correctly
        Counter.getCount() == (self.initialCount + amount): "Counter must equal initial count plus increment amount"
      }
    }
}
```

Execute with a parameter:

```zsh
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/IncrementByAmount.cdc <amount> --network emulator --signer test-account
```

## Testing Your Code

Testing is crucial for smart contract development. Flow provides powerful testing capabilities built into the CLI that enable comprehensive test coverage and test-driven development workflows.

Execute the test suite:

```zsh
flow test
```

You should see output confirming the tests pass:

```zsh
Test results: "Counter_test.cdc"
- PASS: testContract

All tests passed
```

### Understanding Existing Tests

Open `cadence/tests/Counter_test.cdc` to see the existing test:

```cadence
import Test

access(all) let account = Test.createAccount()

access(all) fun testContract() {
    let err = Test.deployContract(
        name: "Counter",
        path: "../contracts/Counter.cdc",
        arguments: []
    )

    Test.expect(err, Test.beNil())
}
```

This basic test:

1. **Creates a test account** using `Test.createAccount()`
2. **Deploys the Counter contract** to the test environment
3. **Verifies deployment succeeded** by checking that no error occurred

### Test Integration with Dependencies

Test the NumberFormatter integration:

```cadence
import Test

access(all) let account = Test.createAccount()

access(all) fun testNumberFormatterLogic() {
    // Test NumberFormatter logic inline without contract deployment
    // Test small number (under 1000) - should have no comma
    let smallNumberScript = Test.executeScript(
        "access(all) fun formatWithCommas(number: Int): String { let isNegative = number < 0; let absNumber = number < 0 ? -number : number; let numberString = absNumber.toString(); var formatted = \"\"; var count = 0; let numberLength = numberString.length; var i = numberLength - 1; while i >= 0 { let digit = numberString.slice(from: i, upTo: i + 1); formatted = digit.concat(formatted); count = count + 1; if count % 3 == 0 && i != 0 { formatted = \",\".concat(formatted) }; i = i - 1 }; if isNegative { formatted = \"-\".concat(formatted) }; return formatted }; access(all) fun main(): String { return formatWithCommas(number: 123) }",
        []
    )
    Test.expect(smallNumberScript, Test.beSucceeded())
    let smallResult = smallNumberScript.returnValue! as! String
    Test.expect(smallResult, Test.equal("123"))

    // Test large number (over 999) - should have comma
    let largeNumberScript = Test.executeScript(
        "access(all) fun formatWithCommas(number: Int): String { let isNegative = number < 0; let absNumber = number < 0 ? -number : number; let numberString = absNumber.toString(); var formatted = \"\"; var count = 0; let numberLength = numberString.length; var i = numberLength - 1; while i >= 0 { let digit = numberString.slice(from: i, upTo: i + 1); formatted = digit.concat(formatted); count = count + 1; if count % 3 == 0 && i != 0 { formatted = \",\".concat(formatted) }; i = i - 1 }; if isNegative { formatted = \"-\".concat(formatted) }; return formatted }; access(all) fun main(): String { return formatWithCommas(number: 1234) }",
        []
    )
    Test.expect(largeNumberScript, Test.beSucceeded())
    let largeResult = largeNumberScript.returnValue! as! String
    Test.expect(largeResult, Test.equal("1,234"))
}
```

The Formatter_test.cdc test validates that number formatting with commas works correctly by testing two scenarios: numbers under 1,000 (which should have no commas) and numbers over 999 (which should have commas). The test is constructed with two main assertions - first testing that 123 formats as "123" without commas, and second testing that 1234 formats as "1,234" with a comma.

### Run Your Enhanced Test Suite

Execute the complete test suite with your new comprehensive tests:

```zsh
flow test
```

You should see output like:

```zsh
Running tests...

Test results: "cadence/tests/Formatter_test.cdc"
- PASS: testNumberFormatterLogic
Test results: "cadence/tests/Counter_test.cdc"
- PASS: testContract

All tests passed
```
