# Token Development and Registration

Flow supports token development through two primary approaches: native Cadence contracts that leverage Flow's unique resource-oriented programming model, and EVM-compatible contracts that enable easy migration from Ethereum. This section provides comprehensive guides for creating tokens using both approaches, along with registration processes to ensure ecosystem visibility.

## Cadence Token Development

### [Creating a Fungible Token]

Learn how to build a complete fungible token contract using Cadence's resource-based programming model. This comprehensive guide covers implementing the Flow Fungible Token standard, managing token vaults for secure storage, creating minter resources for controlled token creation, and deploying with proper metadata views. You'll build a production-ready token that integrates seamlessly with Flow's ecosystem including wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.

### [Creating an NFT Contract]

Master the development of non-fungible token contracts using Flow's powerful Cadence language. This detailed tutorial walks through implementing the Flow NFT standard, creating collection resources for efficient NFT management, building minting mechanisms with access controls, and adding comprehensive metadata support. Learn to create NFTs that work perfectly with marketplaces, wallets, and other Flow ecosystem applications.

### [Register Your Assets in Cadence]

Complete the registration process for your Cadence-based fungible and non-fungible tokens to ensure visibility across the Flow ecosystem. This guide covers submitting your tokens to official registries, providing required metadata and documentation, following community standards for token information, and integrating with major wallets and applications like Flow Wallet and IncrementFi.

## Flow EVM Token Development

### [Register Your ERC20 Token]

Register your ERC20 tokens deployed on Flow EVM to appear in wallets and ecosystem applications. This guide details the GitHub Pull Request process for adding tokens to the Flow standard token list, providing proper token metadata and logos, meeting verification requirements, and ensuring compatibility with Flow Wallet, MetaMask, and other ecosystem tools.

## Conclusion

Flow's dual approach to token development provides developers with flexibility to choose the best paradigm for their projects. Whether leveraging Cadence's innovative resource model for enhanced security and composability, or using familiar EVM patterns for quick deployment, these guides ensure your tokens integrate seamlessly with Flow's thriving ecosystem of wallets, exchanges, and applications.
