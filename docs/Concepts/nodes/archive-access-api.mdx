sidebar_title: Archive Access API
---

The Archive Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

## Flow archive node access endpoints

The Archive Nodes hosted by DapperLabs are accessible at:

#### Current Mainnet
`archive.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Sandboxnet

`archive.sandboxnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Testnet

`archive.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Canarynet

`archive.canary.nodes.onflow.org:9000`

#### Rate limits for Dapper Labs archive nodes

Archive nodes operated by Dapper Labs are [rate limited](https://developers.flow.com/nodes/archive-api-rate-limits).

## Accounts

### GetAccountAtBlockHeight

`GetAccountAtBlockHeight` gets an [account](#accounts) by address at the given block height.

The archive node queries an execution node for the account details, which are stored as part of the execution state.

```protobuf
rpc GetAccountAtBlockHeight(GetAccountAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (AccountResponse)
```


#### Request

```protobuf
message GetAccountAtBlockHeightRequest {
  bytes address
  uint64 block_height
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message AccountResponse {
  Account account
}
```


## Scripts

### ExecuteScriptAtBlockID

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockID` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the block with the given ID.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/json-cadence-spec).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockID (ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```


#### Request

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptAtBlockIDRequest {
  bytes block_id
  bytes script
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptResponse {
  bytes value
}
```



### ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight

`ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight` executes a ready-only Cadence script against the execution state at the given block height.

This method can be used to read account state from the blockchain. The script is executed on an execution node and the return value is encoded using the [JSON-Cadence data interchange format](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/json-cadence-spec).

```protobuf
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight (ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```


#### Request

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest {
  uint64 block_height
  bytes script
}
```




#### Response

```protobuf
message ExecuteScriptResponse {
  bytes value
}
```
