 This section is designed to provide you with comprehensive information and guidance on the various token standards available on the Flow blockchain. These standards establish a unified framework for developers, ensuring seamless interoperability and compatibility between tokens, applications, and wallets.

## Overview
Flow is a fast, secure, and developer-friendly blockchain that supports the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps). One of the primary use cases for dApps is the creation, management, and exchange of digital tokens, which can represent anything from in-game items to digital art to cryptocurrencies.

To facilitate this, the Flow community has developed a set of token standards that provide a consistent interface and structure for creating, transferring, and managing tokens on the Flow blockchain. These standards help ensure that developers can focus on building unique features and user experiences, rather than reinventing the wheel when it comes to basic token functionality.

## Token Standards
In this documentation section, we'll cover the following Flow token standards:

**Fungible Token Standard (FT)**: The FT is a specification for creating and managing fungible tokens, which are tokens with equal value and interchangeable. This standard is most commonly used for creating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets with uniform value.

**Non-Fungible Token Standard (NFT)**: The NFT is a specification for creating and managing non-fungible tokens, which are unique and indivisible digital assets. This standard is used for creating digital art, in-game items, and other one-of-a-kind digital assets.

## Getting Started
To begin exploring the Flow Token Standards documentation, navigate to the desired token standard using the sidebar on the left. Each standard's documentation includes an overview, detailed specification, sample code, and best practices to help you successfully implement and deploy tokens on the Flow blockchain.

By adhering to these token standards, you'll ensure that your tokens are easily accessible and compatible with the broader Flow ecosystem, including wallets, marketplaces, and other dApps.
