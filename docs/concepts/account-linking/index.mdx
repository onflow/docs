# Overview

The Account Linking feature on Flow enables developers to provide seamless onboarding and in-app experiences while
simultaneously empowering users with real ownership and self-sovereignty. With this [new custodial
model](https://forum.onflow.org/t/hybrid-custody/4016), developers can deliver the benefits of both app and self-custody
in a unified experience.

The full user experience is enabled by three core components:
- Walletless Onboarding - App managed account creation, funding, and custody
- Account Linking - App custodied accounts may delegate access to users wallet
- Core `HybridCustody` contract - A standard contract enabling users to view and manage their linked accounts

### User Journey

1. The app creates, funds, and manages access to a Flow account initialized on user onboarding. This enables the app to
   abstract away the complexities of interacting with smart contract powered applications, and focus on creating slick
   user experiences behind familiar Web2 authentication and fiat denominated payments.
1. Once a user returns to the app with a self-custodial wallet, they can authenticate their wallet-managed account in
   the app, allowing the app to give the user's main account delegated access to the app managed account (albeit with
   some developer-defined restrictions).
1. Upon linking, the user's main account - now the "parent" account - adds the app created account - now the "child"
   account - to a collection of all linked child accounts. At this point, Hybrid Custody is reached!

### Why Care?

Account Linking grants users access to their linked child accounts without needing to interface with the child account's
custodial app, **and** the custodial app can interact with the relevant assets in the child account on behalf of the
user in a frictionless UX free from transaction prompts.

All assets in the app account can now jump the walled garden to play in the rest of the Flow ecosystem. No transactions are needed to move assets from the child account to the parent account, as the parent account already has full access to the assets in the child account.

This shared control over the digital items in the in-app account enables users to establish real ownership of the items
beyond the context of the app, where they can use their self-custody wallet to view inventory, take the items to other
apps in the ecosystem, such as a marketplace or a game.

Most importantly, users are able to do this without the need to transfer the digital items between accounts,
making it seamless to continue using the original app while also using other apps.

With account linking, developers can build walletless onboarding experiences for new users that provide a clear path to
self-custody. Continue on to read our guides for more details on how you can use Account Linking to
build spectacular experiences on Flow.

### Guides

- [Building Walletless Applications using Child Accounts](./child-accounts.mdx) covers how apps can leverage Account Linking to create a seamless user
experience and enable future self-custody.
- [Working With Parent Accounts](./parent-accounts.mdx) covers features enabled by the core `HybridCustody` contract to
access child account assets from parent accounts. This is useful for apps like marketplaces or wallets that are working with
accounts that have potential child accounts.
