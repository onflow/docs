title: Get Started with Hybrid Custody
---

There are two sides to Hybrid Custody support - delegation and usage. 

On the delegation side, we have the apps that leverage Hybrid Custody for enhanced UX. This side primarily concerns
itself with walletless onboarding + account linking (IOW account delegation). You can think of a Hybrid Custody game
client or project-specific NFT app.

From the usage perspective, apps would want to get information about a user's linked accounts to display accounts &
assets, enable account & asset management, and even facilitate cross account interactions - think of this from the
perspective of a wallet or NFT marketplace.

Note that the documentation on Hybrid Custody covers the current state and will likely differ from the final
implementation. **Testnet is currently out of sync with docs and will be updated shortly.** Builders should be aware
that breaking changes may follow before reaching a final community consensus on implementation. Interested in
contributing? [Check out the source!](https://github.com/onflow/hybrid-custody).

In either case, you'll want to do the following to get started implementing Hybrid Custody in your application:

1. [Install Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tooling/flow-cli/install)
1. Create a project from the [Hybrid Custody scaffold](https://github.com/onflow/hybrid-custody-scaffold):
   
   ```sh
   flow setup build-hybrid-custody --scaffold
   ```

   You'll be asked to select the scaffold number for this scaffold, enter `4` for Hybrid Custody Project

   ```sh
   âœ” Enter the scaffold number: 4
   ```

1. Change to your new project directory and follow the README to get started!

   ```sh
   cd build-hybrid-custody
   ```
