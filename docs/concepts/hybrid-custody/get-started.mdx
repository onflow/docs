title: Get Started with Hybrid Custody
---

There are two sides to Hybrid Custody support - delegation and usage. 

On the delegation side, we have the apps that leverage Hybrid Custody for enhanced UX. This side primarily concerns
itself with walletless onboarding + account linking (IOW account delegation). You can think of a Hybrid Custody game
client or project-specific NFT app.

From the usage perspective, apps would want to get information about a user's linked accounts to display accounts &
assets, enable account & asset management, and even facilitate cross account interactions - think of this from the
perspective of a wallet or NFT marketplace.

Note that the documentation on Hybrid Custody covers the current state and will likely differ from the final
implementation. Builders should be aware that breaking changes may follow before reaching a final consensus on
implementation. Interested in shaping the conversation? [Join in!](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/72)

In either case, you'll want to do the following to get started implementing Hybrid Custody in your application:

1. [Install Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tooling/flow-cli/install)
1. Run the following commands:
   
   ```sh
   flow setup learn-hybrid-custody --scaffold
   ```

   You'll be asked to select the [scaffold](https://github.com/onflow/hybrid-custody-scaffold) number for this scaffold,
   enter `4` for Hybrid Custody Project

   ```sh
   ✔ Enter the scaffold number: 4
   ```

1. Change to your project directory and start building!

   ```sh
   cd learn-hybrid-custody
   ```
