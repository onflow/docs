There are community access nodes available for use, but they are rate limited. Anyone can run their own access node. This is a good option if you want to have untrottled access to the flow blockchain or want to run a node for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

## Setup

For dapps it might become necessary to run your own access node. Here are the step by step instructions to [run an access node](../../concepts/nodes/node-operation/access-node-setup#how-to-run-a-permissionless-access-node)
