# How to Build for Mobile

# Overview

The following documentation aims to educate you on building a native mobile application on Flow. It first presents Monster Maker, a starter project weâ€™ve built to represent simple Flow mobile concepts. Next it presents various developer resources related to building mobile native Flow applications.

# Monster Maker

![monster_maker_logo.png](resources/monster_maker_logo.png)

Monster Maker is a native iOS app that allows users to connect a wallet, sign a transaction to mint an NFT (a monster) and display their collection of NFTs (their monsters) within the app. Itâ€™s meant to be a lightweight sample project to exemplify how to build a mobile native Flow project. If youâ€™re looking to build a native mobile application for Flow, exploring the Monster Maker code base first or even building off of it is a great way to get started.

## Github Repo

The Monster Maker Github Repo can be found here:

https://github.com/onflow/monster-maker

## Building to Device

Before you run Monster Maker on your device, please make sure you have installed the [Xcode14](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from Mac App Store. Once you clone the repo, open the [MonsterMaker.xcodeproj](https://github.com/onflow/monster-maker/tree/main/iOS/MonsterMaker.xcodeproj) under the iOS folder.

Xcode should automatically setup the project for you. If you do see any error related to dependencies, run `Xcode Menu -> File -> Packages -> Reset Package Cache` to resolve the issue.

In the meantime, you can choose a simulator or your iPhone to run. For more detail here is the [official doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device).
For run in real device, there are a few steps to deal with signing:

1. Add your apple account to the Xcode which can be accessed from `Xcode Menu -> Settings -> Add account`.
2. Change the Team to your Personal Apple account from the **Signing & Capabilities** under the project target menu. For more detail, please check the screenshot below.

## Connecting to a Wallet

To connect with wallets, there is native wallet discovery in the app. Once you click on connect, it will bring out the list of the wallets which support `HTTP/POST` or `WC/RPC` method.

### FCL Config

To make sure, the wallet can recognise your dApp, there is a few field you will need to config before connect to a wallet. The account proof config is optional. In addition, you will need to create a project id from [walletconnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app) cloud before you can connect to the `WC/RPC` compatible wallet such as dapper self custody or lilico wallet.

```swift
import FCL

// Config the App
let defaultProvider: FCL.Provider = .dapperPro
let defaultNetwork: Flow.ChainID = .testnet // or .mainnet

// Optinal: Config for account proof
let accountProof = FCL.Metadata.AccountProofConfig(appIdentifier: "Monster Maker")

// Config for WC/RPC compatible wallet
let walletConnect = FCL.Metadata.WalletConnectConfig(urlScheme: "monster-maker://", projectID: "12ed93a2aae83134c4c8473ca97d9399")

// Config basic dApp info
let metadata = FCL.Metadata(appName: "Monster Maker",
                            appDescription: "Monster Maker Demo App for mobile",
                            appIcon: URL(string: "https://i.imgur.com/jscDmDe.png")!,
                            location: URL(string: "https://monster-maker.vercel.app/")!,
                            accountProof: accountProof,
                            walletConnectConfig: walletConnect)
fcl.config(metadata: metadata,
           env: defaultNetwork,
           provider: defaultProvider)

// Import keywords replacement for cadence query and transaction
fcl.config
    .put("0xFungibleToken", value: "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20")
    .put("0xMonsterMaker", value: "0xfd3d8fe2c8056370")
    .put("0xMetadataViews", value: "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20")
    .put("0xTransactionGeneration", value: "0x44051d81c4720882")
```

### Open wallet discovery

![In Monster Maker, the Connect button triggers opening of Wallet Discovery](resources/connect.png)

In Monster Maker, the Connect button triggers opening of Wallet Discovery

For the wallet support `HTTP/POST`, it will use webview to show the following actions.

For the wallet support `WC/RPC`, it will use deep-link to the wallet for actions.

You can open the native wallet discovery to make the selection, but also you can connect to the specific wallet as well.

Here is the code snippet of it:

```swift
import FCL

// Open discovery view
fcl.openDiscovery()

// Or manual connect to specific wallet
try fcl.changeProvider(provider: provider, env: .testnet)
try await fcl.authenticate()
```

## Signing a Transaction

![In Monster Maker, Initializing the NFT collection with the Initialize button triggers a transaction.](resources/initialize.png)

In Monster Maker, Initializing the NFT collection with the Initialize button triggers a transaction.

Similar to what we have on fcl-js, native sdk also use `query` and `mutate` for on-chain interactions. To request a signature from user, you can simply use `fcl.mutate` method. By default, the user will be the payer, proposer and authorizer, if you want to add custom authorizer please refer to the code from [Server](https://github.com/onflow/monster-maker/blob/main/server/pages/api/signAsMinter/index.ts) and [iOS](https://github.com/onflow/monster-maker/blob/main/iOS/MonsterMaker/Flow/MintHelper.swift) end.

```swift
guard let user = fcl.currentUser else {
    // Not signin
    return
}

let txId = try await fcl.mutate(
                            cadence: """
                                    transaction(test: String, testInt: Int) {
                                                   prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
                                                        log(signer.address)
                                                        log(test)
                                                        log(testInt)
                                                   }
                                               }
                                    """,
                            args: [
														.string("Hello"),
                            .int(10)
                           ],
                            gasLimit: 999,
                            authorizors: [user])

print("txId -> \(txId)")
```

## View NFT

![The View page in Monster Maker exemplifies showing Monster Maker NFTs held by the connected wallet](resources/collection.png)

The View page in Monster Maker exemplifies showing Monster Maker NFTs held by the connected wallet

To view the NFT from an wallet address, first and foremost, we highly recommend you use [NFT-Catalog](https://www.flow-nft-catalog.com/) standard when you are ready. So that it will be easy to allow other platform like marketplace and wallet to recognise and display your NFT collection. However, during development, you always can query your NFT with `fcl.query`. Here is an example:

- Query cadence

    ```swift
    import NonFungibleToken from 0xNonFungibleToken
        import MonsterMaker from 0xMonsterMaker
        import MetadataViews from 0xMetadataViews
        
        pub struct Monster {
            pub let name: String
            pub let description: String
            pub let thumbnail: String
            pub let itemID: UInt64
            pub let resourceID: UInt64
            pub let owner: Address
            pub let component: MonsterMaker.MonsterComponent
    
            init(
                name: String,
                description: String,
                thumbnail: String,
                itemID: UInt64,
                resourceID: UInt64,
                owner: Address,
                component: MonsterMaker.MonsterComponent
            ) {
                self.name = name
                self.description = description
                self.thumbnail = thumbnail
                self.itemID = itemID
                self.resourceID = resourceID
                self.owner = owner
                self.component = component
            }
        }
    
        pub fun getMonsterById(address: Address, itemID: UInt64): Monster? {
    
            if let collection = getAccount(address).getCapability<&MonsterMaker.Collection{NonFungibleToken.CollectionPublic, MonsterMaker.MonsterMakerCollectionPublic}>(MonsterMaker.CollectionPublicPath).borrow() {
                
                if let item = collection.borrowMonsterMaker(id: itemID) {
                    if let view = item.resolveView(Type<MetadataViews.Display>()) {
                        let display = view as! MetadataViews.Display
                        let owner: Address = item.owner!.address!
                        let thumbnail = display.thumbnail as! MetadataViews.HTTPFile
    
                        return Monster(
                            name: display.name,
                            description: display.description,
                            thumbnail: thumbnail.url,
                            itemID: itemID,
                            resourceID: item.uuid,
                            owner: address,
                            component: item.component
                        )
                    }
                }
            }
    
            return nil
        }
    
        pub fun main(address: Address): [Monster] {
            let account = getAccount(address)
            let collectionRef = account.getCapability(MonsterMaker.CollectionPublicPath)!.borrow<&{NonFungibleToken.CollectionPublic}>()
                ?? panic("Could not borrow capability from public collection")
            
            let ids = collectionRef.getIDs()
    
            let monsters : [Monster] = []
    
            for id in ids {
                if let monster = getMonsterById(address: address, itemID: id) {
                    monsters.append(monster)
                }
            }
    
            return monsters
        }
    ```


```swift
let nftList = try await fcl.query(script: cadenceScript, 
																		args: [.address(address)])
														.decode([NFTModel].self)
```
