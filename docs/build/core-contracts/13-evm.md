# Contract

The `EVM` contract is the entrypoint from Cadence to Flow EVM. While many developers may choose to interact with EVM
via [EVM-equivalent tooling paths](../../evm/using.mdx), all access to Flow EVM ultimately interfaces via Cadence at
some level.

If you would like to interact with EVM directly from Cadence, you can use the `EVM` contract and it's constructs. Read
more about the EVM contract and its role in Flow's EVM equivalence in [FLIP
#223](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20231116-evm-support.md).
