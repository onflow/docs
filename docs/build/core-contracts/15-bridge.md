The Flow VM bridge is the account and series of smart contracts that manage how
assets are safely bridged between the Cadence and EVM Flow Environments.

| Network                   | Contract Address     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Emulator                  | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7` |
| Cadence Testing Framework | `0x0000000000000001` |
| Testnet                   | `0xdfc20aee650fcbdf` |
| Mainnet                   | `0x1e4aa0b87d10b141` |

# Contracts

There are many important contracts deployed to the bridge account.
You should refer to [the bridge repo](https://github.com/onflow/flow-evm-bridge)
and [the bridge guides](../../blockchain-development-tutorials/cross-vm-apps/vm-bridge.md)
for more detailed information about the bridge and tutorials for how to use the bridge properly.

Here is a list of each Cadence contract used for the bridge:

# EVM Bridge Solidity Contracts

There are also Solidity contracts that are deployed in Flow EVM that are needed for the bridge.
Here are their addresses:

And below are the bridge escrow's EVM addresses. These addresses are [`CadenceOwnedAccount`s (COA)](https://developers.flow.com/blockchain-development-tutorials/cross-vm-apps/interacting-with-coa#coa-interface) and they are stored stored in the same Flow account as you'll find the Cadence contracts (see above).
