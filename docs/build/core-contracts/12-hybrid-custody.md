# Contract

The Account Linking contracts manage ChildAccounts to permit hybrid custody in scenarios where apps only want to share a subset of resources on their accounts with various parents. In many cases, this will be a user's primary wallet outside of the application a child account came from.

You can see the docs for account linking [here](https://developers.flow.com/build/advanced-concepts/account-linking)
