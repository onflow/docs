# Contract

The `FlowIDTableStaking` contract is the central table that manages staked nodes, delegation and rewards.

Source: [FlowIDTableStaking.cdc](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/blob/master/contracts/FlowIDTableStaking.cdc)

| Network           | Contract Address     |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Emulator          | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7` |
| Cadence Testing Framework | `0x0000000000000001` |
| PreviewNet        | `0xb6763b4399a888c8` |
| Testnet | `0x9eca2b38b18b5dfe` |
| Mainnet           | `0x8624b52f9ddcd04a` |

# Transactions and Scripts

Transactions for the staking contract are in the `flow-core-contracts` repo.
Developers and users are advised to use [the staking collection transactions](../../networks/staking/14-staking-collection.md)
to stake tokens instead of the basic transactions that are used for tests.

## Getting Staking Info with Scripts

These scripts are read-only and get info about the current state of the staking contract.

## Delegator Transactions

Documentation for delegating with tokens is described in the staking documentation
for [the staking collection](../../networks/staking/14-staking-collection.md)

# Events

The `FlowIDTableStaking` contract emits an event whenever an important action occurs.
See the [staking events Documentation](../../networks/staking/07-staking-scripts-events.md) for more information about each event.
