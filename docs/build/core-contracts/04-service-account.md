The service account is the account that manages the core protocol requirements of Flow.
There are three contracts deployed to the service account:

- `FlowServiceAccount` tracks transaction fees, deployment permissions, and provides 
some convenience methods for Flow Token operations.

- `RandomBeaconHistory` stores the history of random sources generated by
the Flow network. The defined Heartbeat resource is
updated by the Flow Service Account at the end of every block
with that block's source of randomness.

- `NodeVersionBeacon` holds the past
and future protocol versions that should be used
to execute/handle blocks at a given block height.
