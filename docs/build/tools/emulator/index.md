The Flow Emulator is a lightweight tool that emulates the behavior of the real Flow network for local development and testing.

## Quick Start

Start the Flow Emulator with the CLI:

```bash
flow emulator
```

This starts a local Flow network on `http://localhost:8888` with the Access API available.

## Installation

The emulator is included with the [Flow CLI](../flow-cli/index.md). Follow the [installation guide](../flow-cli/install.md) to get started.

## Additional Resources

For advanced configuration options, see the [Flow Emulator repository](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator/).
