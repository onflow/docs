# Installation

This chapter explains the installation of the Flow CLient Library (FCL) JS library in your system. However, before we move to the installation, let's verify the prerequisite first.

## Prerequisite
- Node.js version v12.0.0 or higher. 

FCL JS depends on Node.js version v12.0.0 or higher. You can check your currently-installed version with the below command:

```javascript
node --version
```

If Node.js is not installed on your system, you can visit [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install it. 


Install FCL JS with **npm** or **yarn**

```shell
npm i -S @onflow/fcl
```

```shell
yarn add @onflow/fcl
```
#### Importing

**ES6**
```js
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl";
```
**Node.js**
```js
const fcl = require("@onflow/fcl");
```
