# Flow App Quickstart

---

This guide is a simple walkthrough to get started building a web3 app using the Flow Client Library (FCL).

<Callout type="info">
If you are looking for a scalfolds, check out [scaffolds available in the Flow CLI](../../tools/flow-cli/super-commands.md#using-scaffolds).
</Callout>

This simple guide uses the "Hello World" scaffold, it is meant to provide all the code needed to get a web application up and running.

## Introduction

![Flow app anatomy](flow-dapp-anatomy.png)

<Callout type="info">
FCL (aka Flow Client Library) wraps the logic needed to communicate with the Flow blockchain. It's a npm package, [More Information](../../tools/clients/fcl-js)
</Callout>

This guide assumes a good understanding of React. The concepts are easy to understand and apply to other libraries and framework. A strong understanding of Cadence (Flow's smart contract language) is not required. More information on Cadence, [learning the Cadence language](./smart-contracts/cadence.md).

### FCL concepts covered:

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Authenticate a user](#authenticate-a-user)
- [Deploy contracts](#deploy-contracts)
- [Query the Blockchain](#query-the-blockchain)
- [Mutate the Blockchain](#mutate-the-blockchain)

For more help, [Discord](https://discord.gg/flow). See links at the end of this article for diving deeper into building on Flow.

## Installation

Make sure you have Flow CLI installed. [installation instructions](../../tools/flow-cli/install.md).

## Configuration

### Setting up Flow

Using the Flow CLI scaffold, create a basic hello world web project with `Web Scaffolds` -> `[5] FCL Web Dapp`. This will create a new `flow.json` file in the `hello-world` folder. This file will contain the Flow configuration for your project.

```sh
flow setup hello-world --scaffold
# select scaffold 5
cd hello-world
npm install
# run the app in a later step
```

We don't recommend keeping private keys in your `flow.json`, notice that Flow CLI already moved the emulator private key to a `emulator.key` file and point to it using the [key/location pattern](../../tools/flow-cli/flow.json/security.md#private-account-configuration-file). This file should be added to your `.gitignore` file, so it won't be committed to your repository. 

We won't be using emulator and running contracts locally in this quickstart, but FCL will complain if it finds private keys in your `flow.json` file.

Your `flow.json` file should look like this:

```
{
	"networks": {
		"emulator": "127.0.0.1:3569",
		"mainnet": "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
		"sandboxnet": "access.sandboxnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
		"testnet": "access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
	},
	"accounts": {
		"emulator-account": {
			"address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key": {
				"type": "file",
				"location": "./emulator.key"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

<Callout type="info">
The `flow.json` file is used to keep track of deployed contracts and accounts. [More Information](../../tools/clients/fcl-js/api#using-flowjson)
</Callout>


### Configuring FCL

Next, notice `@onflow/fcl` has been added to the `package.json` and the web application is ready to be run. 

<Callout type="info">
There are a lot of benefits to getting familiar with existing Flow CLI scaffolds. For example the `hello-world` scaffold already has fcl configuration settings to run on local emulator. 
</Callout>


The `hello-world` web application comes with convenience npm commands to facilitate a quick start. The following command will preform: 
  1. Start emulator
  2. Start dev wallet
  3. Start web app

<Callout type="info">
Emulator is a local blockchain [More Information](../../tools/emulator/index.md). Emulator has all the features as testnet and mainnet blockchains 
</Callout>

```sh
npm run dev:local
```

Now that your app is running. FCL loads the configuration in `config/fcl.ts` This file contains configuration information for FCL, such as what Access Node and wallet discovery endpoint and which network to use (e.g. testnet or a local emulator). 

- `accessNode.api` key specifies the address of a Flow access node. There are publically available access nodes, but have to rate limit. Alternatively, applications might want to run an Observer node [Run a Node](../../references/run-and-secure/node-operation/observer-node.mdx).
- `discovery.wallet` is an address that points to a service that lists FCL compatible wallets. Flow's FCL Discovery service is a service that FCL wallet providers can be added to, and be made 'discoverable' to any application that uses the `discovery.wallet` endpoint.

Also, notice that `package.json` uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLOW_NETWORK=local` for `dev` command, this is used to set the network in `config/fcl.ts`.
<Callout type="info">
Learn more about [configuring Discovery](../../tools/clients/fcl-js/discovery.mdx) or [setting configuration values](../../tools/clients/fcl-js/api.md#setting-configuration-values).
</Callout>

The main Next.js app component is located in `pages/_app.tsx`. It should import the config file `config/fcl.ts` already and should look like this:

```jsx
import '../styles/globals.css'
import DefaultLayout from '../layouts/DefaultLayout'

// Import FCL config
import '../config/fcl'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <DefaultLayout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </DefaultLayout>
  )
}

export default MyApp

```

The main page for the Next.js app is located in `pages/index.tsx`. It should contain some basic UI and should look like this:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
import Links from '../components/Links'
import Container from '../components/Container'
import useCurrentUser from '../hooks/useCurrentUser'

export default function Home() {
  const { loggedIn } = useCurrentUser()

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>

      <Head>
        <title>FCL Next Scaffold</title>
        <meta name="description" content="FCL Next Scaffold for the Flow Blockchain" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1 className={styles.title}>
          <a href="https://developers.flow.com/tools/fcl-js">FCL</a> Next Scaffold
        </h1>

        <p className={styles.description}>
          For the Flow Blockchain
        </p>

        {loggedIn && <Container />}

        <Links />

      </main>
    </div>
  )
}

```

Now we're ready to start talking to Flow! 
<Callout type="warning">
The web app will run, but there are no contracts deployed to local emulator. This is a step in [Query the Blockchain](#query-the-blockchain) section. 
</Callout>

## Authenticate a User

![User Login](./user-login-hello-world.gif)

Note: in the code above `useCurrentUser` is used to determine if there is a logged in user. 

There are two methods to allow the user to login. `fcl.logIn()` or `fcl.authenticate()` [More Information on, authenticate](../../tools/clients/fcl-js/api#authenticate)

In `components/Navbar.tsx` a button wires up the authentication method `fcl.authenticate()`. It is used to bring up the list of supported wallets. See below

Once authenticated, FCL uses a hook `const user = useCurrentUser()` to get the user data, when user is signed in `user.loggedIn` flag is `true`. For more information on the `currentUser`, read more [here](../../tools/clients/fcl-js/api.md#current-user).

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'
import * as fcl from '@onflow/fcl'
import useCurrentUser from '../hooks/useCurrentUser'
import navbarStyles from '../styles/Navbar.module.css'
import elementStyles from '../styles/Elements.module.css'

export default function Navbar() {
  const user = useCurrentUser()

  return (
    <div className={navbarStyles.navbar}>
      {!user.loggedIn && 
        <button 
          onClick={fcl.authenticate} 
          className={elementStyles.button}>
          Log In With Wallet
        </button>
      }
      {user.loggedIn && 
        (
          <>
            <div className={navbarStyles.address}>{ user?.addr }</div>
            <button 
              onClick={fcl.unauthenticate} 
              className={elementStyles.button}>
              Log Out
            </button>
          </>
        )
      }
    </div>
  )
}

```

You should now be able to log in or sign up users and unauthenticate them. Upon logging in or signing up your users will see a popup where they can choose between wallet providers. Choose the `dev wallet` to use the same account that deployed the `HelloWorld` contract, this is needed for mutation. Upon completing authentication, you'll see the component change and the user's wallet address appear on the screen if you've completed this properly.

<Callout type="info">
More on wallets, [Flow Core wallet](https://core.flow.com/) is a Reference Flow wallet. 
</Callout>

## Deploy contracts

Hello World scaffold does come with a Cadence contract. You will notice `HelloWorld.cdc` has been deployed when running `npm run dev:local`. Look at hello-world `package.json` to see the commands that get run, `flow dev` deploys contracts to the emulator.
In the `flow.json` make sure the emulator endpoint is correct. Look at the terminal the emulator is running, 

![Emulator Output](./emulator-output.png)

1. Make sure the emulator is using the same port as `gRPC` and 
2. The `deployment` section of `flow.json` should look something like this: 
```json
  ...
	"networks": {
		"emulator": "127.0.0.1:3569",
    ...
  },
	"deployments": {
		"emulator": {
			"default": [
				"HelloWorld"
			]
		}	
}	

```

Verify that `flow.json` updates with HelloWorld contract information, `contracts` has the `HelloWorld` contract and `deployments` shows that `HelloWorld` has been deployed.


```json
{
	"contracts": {
		"HelloWorld": "cadence/contracts/HelloWorld.cdc"
	},
	"networks": {
		"emulator": "127.0.0.1:3569",
		"mainnet": "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
		"testnet": "access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
	},
	"accounts": {
		"default": {
			"address": "01cf0e2f2f715450",
			"key": "..."
		},
		"emulator-account": {
			"address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key": {
				"type": "file",
				"location": "./emulator.key"
			}
		}
	},
	"deployments": {
		"emulator": {
			"default": [
				"HelloWorld"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

For more information on deployments check [Flow CLI](../../tools/flow-cli/flow.json/manage-configuration.md) documentation

## Query the Blockchain

Now that all pieces are in place. UI can query `HelloWorld` contract.


![Query HelloWorld Contract](./query-helloWorld-contract.gif)


The script that queries the Hello World contract is located `hello-world/cadence/scripts/ReadHelloWorld.cdc`

```cadence
import "HelloWorld"

pub fun main(): String {
  return HelloWorld.greeting
}
```

In `components/Container.tsx` file, `fcl.query` is used to set the Cadence script and query the contract.

```jsx

  const queryChain = async () => {
    const res = await fcl.query({
      cadence: ReadHelloWorld
    })

    setChainGreeting(res)
  }
```

It is that simple!

## Mutate the Blockchain

Update the `HelloWorld` contract greeting. Notice that Greeting gets changed when the transaction gets processed.

![Update contract](./hello-world-update-contract.gif)


In `components/Container.tsx` file, the `mutateGreeting` method `fcl.mutate` sends `UpdateHelloWorld` cadence which triggers a transaction that the user signs.

```javascript
 const mutateGreeting = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()

    if (!userGreetingInput.length) {
      throw new Error('Please add a new greeting string.')
    }

    const transactionId = await fcl.mutate({
      cadence: UpdateHelloWorld,
      args: (arg, t) => [arg(userGreetingInput, t.String)],
    })

    setLastTransactionId(transactionId)
  }

```
