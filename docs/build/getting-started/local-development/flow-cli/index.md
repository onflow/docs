## Installation

Follow [these steps](../flow-cli/install.md) to install the Flow CLI on 
macOS, Linux, and Windows.


## Create your first project
With the Flow CLI super commands, initiating your new project becomes effortless. Execute the flow setup 
command and make a selection from a variety of accessible scaffolds:
```
> flow setup hello-world --scaffold

🔨 General Scaffolds
   [1] Empty Cadence Project - Empty project containing only basic folder structure and flow.json configuration.
   [2] Simple Cadence Project - Scaffold contains required folder structure as well as some example Cadence code.
   [3] Cadence NFT Project - Scaffold contains the ExampleNFT sample NFT contract.
   [4] Hybrid Custody Project - Starter for exploring & implementing Hybrid Custody.

💻 Web Scaffolds
   [5] FCL Web Dapp - Simple TypeScript web application using next.js, FCL, and Cadence.

📱 Mobile Scaffolds
   [6] Swift iOS simple example - iOS example demonstrating usage of FCL and Flow interactions.
   [7] Android simple example - Android example demonstrating usage of FCL and Flow interactions.
   [8] FCL React Native Mobile Dapp - React Native (Expo) mobile dapp example demonstrating FCL and Flow interactions.

🏀 Unity Scaffolds
   [9] Simple Unity - Simple example demonstrating how to interact with the Flow network using Unity SDK.
   [10] Mobile Unity Game - Example words game built on Flow using the Unity SDK.
```

After you have created your new project you can proceed writing contracts and by running `dev` 
command the CLI will make sure they are deployed to the Flow emulator for you. Flow emulator is 
a simplified version of Flow network you can use locally to develop. 

So proceed by starting the emulator: 

Once you've established your new project, you can begin writing your own Cadence contracts. 
By utilizing the `flow dev` command, the CLI will take care of deploying them to 
the Flow emulator on your behalf. The Flow emulator serves as a simple version of the Flow network, 
enabling you to carry out local development.

Start the emulator by running:

```
> flow emulator
```

And then the flow dev:
```
> flow dev
```
