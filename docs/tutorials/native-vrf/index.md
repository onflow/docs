# Native VRF Tutorials

This series covers how to leverage Flow's native VRF (Verifiable Random Function) capabilities in both Cadence and Solidity smart contracts. Flow's Random Beacon provides cryptographically secure randomness at the protocol level, eliminating the need for external oracles and their associated costs.

## Tutorials

- **[Secure Randomness with Commit-Reveal in Cadence]** - Learn how to implement secure randomness in Cadence using Flow's commit-reveal scheme.
- **[Deploy a Solidity Contract Using Cadence]** - Discover how to deploy and interact with Solidity contracts on Flow EVM using Cadence.

## More Coming Soon

Stay tuned—more tutorials and advanced guides are on the way!
