# Native VRF (Built-in Randomness) Tutorials

Flow is a **blockchain with built-in randomness**, powered by its native **VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** capabilities. Unlike other blockchains that require external oracles, Flow’s **Random Beacon** provides cryptographically secure randomness **at the protocol level**. Eliminating extra costs, reducing latency, and improving reliability for decentralized applications.

These tutorials cover how to implement secure randomness directly in both **Cadence** and **Solidity** smart contracts on Flow. Whether you’re building on Flow’s native environment or Flow EVM, you can generate unbiased, verifiable random values without third-party dependencies.

## Tutorials

### [Secure Randomness with Commit-Reveal in Cadence] 

Learn how to implement secure randomness in Cadence using Flow’s commit-reveal scheme, ensuring fairness and resistance to manipulation.

### [VRF (Randomness) in Solidity]

Learn how to use Flow’s **native verifiable randomness** in Solidity smart contracts on Flow EVM, including best practices, security considerations, and complete code examples.

### [Deploy a Solidity Contract Using Cadence]

Discover how to deploy and interact with Solidity contracts on Flow EVM using Cadence, enabling cross-environment randomness integrations.

## Why Flow for Randomness?

- Protocol-level randomness: No need for external oracles or APIs.

- Lower costs: Built-in randomness means no extra transaction fees.

- Enhanced security: Cryptographically secure and verifiable on-chain.

- Cross-language support: Works seamlessly in both Cadence and Solidity.

- Speed: Flow is a [fast blockchain] with the design goal of 1,000,000 transactions per second. 

## More Coming Soon

Stay tuned, more advanced tutorials on the Flow native VRF and **built-in blockchain randomness** are on the way, including gaming, NFT minting, and lottery contract examples.
