# Gelato Smart Wallet Integration Guide

Gas fees are one of the biggest barriers to blockchain adoption. Users often need to hold native tokens just to pay for transaction fees, creating friction in onboarding and limiting the types of applications that can be built. Gelato Smart Wallet solves this problem by enabling **gasless transactions** on Flow EVM through sponsored transactions.

With Gelato Smart Wallet, you can:
- **Eliminate gas fees** for your users by sponsoring their transactions
- **Improve user experience** with seamless onboarding that doesn't require users to hold FLOW tokens
- **Support EIP-7702** for enhanced smart wallet functionality
- **Scale your dApp** by removing the cost barrier for user interactions
- **Leverage Flow's low gas costs** to provide affordable sponsored transactions

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Gelato Smart Wallet to enable gasless transactions on Flow EVM. You'll learn how to configure the necessary API keys, fund your sponsorship account, and implement gasless transaction functionality in your applications.

:::info

This tutorial focuses on **EIP-7702** implementation with Gelato Smart Wallet on Flow EVM. EIP-7702 provides a streamlined experience for users by maintaining the same address as their EOA while adding smart wallet capabilities, enabling enhanced features like gasless transactions and improved user experience.

:::

## Objectives

After completing this guide, you'll be able to:

- Configure a Gelato Smart Wallet account with proper API keys and funding setup
- Implement gasless transaction functionality using the Gelato Smart Wallet SDK
- Estimate and execute sponsored transactions on Flow EVM
- Integrate EIP-7702 features for enhanced user experience
- Troubleshoot common issues with Gelato Smart Wallet integration

## Prerequisites of using Gelato Smart Wallet

You need to set up the following in the Gelato App to create a Gelato Sponsor API Key:

### Step 1. Create Your Gelato Account

Sign up on the [Gelato App] to establish an account. This account is the foundation for setting up relay tasks and managing gas sponsorships.

### Step 2. Create a Relay App

Within your Gelato account, create a new _Relay App_ with the Flow EVM network.  
For Testnet, you can first allow `Any contract` to call your relay app.

:::warning

You'll need to add more information for your smart contracts at a later date.

When set to a specific contract instead of `Any contract`, the API keys will only allow sponsored transactions for calls to the designated methods within the ABI of that contract.

:::

### Step 3. Deposit Funds into 1Balance

To use Gelato for sponsored transactions, you need to deposit funds into 1Balance according to your target environment:

- Mainnets: Deposit USDC.
- Testnets: Deposit Sepolia ETH.

Click the `1Balance` tab to deposit `.001` Sepolia ETH testnet funds.

If you need to fund your account, you can use one of the following third-party faucets:

- [Google Cloud Sepolia Faucet]
- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet]
- [Chainlink Sepolia Faucet]
- [Metamask Sepolia Faucet]

### Step 4. Create/Obtain an API Key

After creating the Relay App, navigate to its dashboard to locate your Sponsor API Key.

This key links your Gelato setup with 1Balance for gas sponsorship.

Copy the API key to your clipboard.

## Send Gasless Transactions for your users

After you have created a Sponsor API Key and deposited funds into 1Balance, you can use gasless transactions features for your users.  

With the Gelato Smart Wallet SDK, developers can easily set up sponsored transactions for their applications in just a few simple steps, enabling seamless onboarding and interaction without requiring users to hold native tokens.

:::note

You can find the examples in the [Gelato Smart Wallet SDK] repository.

### Step 1. Install all relevant dependencies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>
    ```bash
    pnpm add @gelatonetwork/smartwallet viem
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @gelatonetwork/smartwallet viem
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @gelatonetwork/smartwallet viem
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @gelatonetwork/smartwallet viem
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2. Setup Smart Wallet Account

Import required dependencies:

```ts
import { createGelatoSmartWalletClient, sponsored } from "@gelatonetwork/smartwallet";
import { gelato } from "@gelatonetwork/smartwallet/accounts";
import { createWalletClient, createPublicClient, http, type Hex } from "viem";
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { flowTestnet } from "viem/chains";

// Create a public client for the Flow Testnet
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: flowTestnet,
  transport: http(),
});
```

You can set up a Smart Account as per your needs.  
Once you create the `gelato` account, the Gelato Smart Account address will be the same as your EOA, enabling EIP-7702 features.

```ts
// Prepare a normal EOA account
const privateKey = (process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ?? generatePrivateKey()) as Hex;
const owner = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

// Wrap the EOA account into a Gelato Smart account
const account = await gelato({
  owner,
  client: publicClient,
});
```

Then you need to create a standard viem wallet client with the Gelato Smart Account.

```ts
const client = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: flowTestnet,
  transport: http()
});
```

Once you have a standard viem wallet client, you can wrap it into a Gelato Smart Wallet client with the sponsor API key.

```ts
const sponsorApiKey = process.env.SPONSOR_API_KEY;
if (!sponsorApiKey) {
  throw new Error("SPONSOR_API_KEY is not set");
}

const swc = await createGelatoSmartWalletClient(client, {
  apiKey: sponsorApiKey
});
```

### Step 3. Estimate or Send a Gasless Transaction

Now you can estimate or send a gasless transaction with the Gelato Smart Wallet client.

To estimate the fee and gas for a gasless transaction, you can use the `estimate` method.

```ts
const response = await swc.estimate({
  payment: sponsored(sponsorApiKey),
  calls: [
    {
      to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
      data: "0xd09de08a",
      value: 0n
    }
  ]
});

console.log(`Estimated fee: ${formatEther(BigInt(response.fee.amount))} FLOW`);
console.log(`Estimated gas: ${JSON.stringify(response.gas)} GAS`);
```

To send a gasless transaction, you can use the `execute` method.

```ts
const results = await smartWalletClient.execute({
    payment : sponsored(sponsorApiKey),
    calls: [
      {
        to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
        data: "0xd09de08a",
        value: 0n
      }
    ]
});

console.log("userOp hash:", results?.id);
const txHash = await results?.wait();
console.log("transaction hash",txHash);
```

Or you can use `prepare` + `send` to send a gasless transaction.

```ts
const preparedCalls = await swc.prepare({
  payment: sponsored(sponsorApiKey),
  calls: [
    {
      to: "0xa8851f5f279eD47a292f09CA2b6D40736a51788E",
      data: "0xd09de08a",
      value: 0n
    }
  ]
});

// Other actions can be performed here

const results = await swc.send({
  preparedCalls
});

// You can listen for events from the Gelato Smart Wallet client
results.on("submitted", (status: GelatoTaskStatus) => {
  console.log(`Transaction submitted: ${status.transactionHash}`);
});
results.on("success", async (status: GelatoTaskStatus) => {
  console.log(`Transaction successful: ${status.transactionHash}`);
});
results.on("error", (error: Error) => {
  console.error(`Transaction failed: ${error.message}`);
});
```
