# Flow Data Sources

Flow Data Sources is a comprehensive repository that automatically aggregates and formats Flow ecosystem content into Markdown files optimized for AI ingestion. This resource serves as a centralized knowledge base for AI tools, chatbots, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

## Overview

The repository contains Python scripts that:

- Crawl Flow-related documentation sites, GitHub repositories, and discussions
- Convert HTML content to Markdown format
- Extract code examples from GitHub repositories
- Capture community discussions and Q&A content
- Merge all content into consolidated files for easy consumption

## Key Features

- **Daily Updates**: Content is automatically refreshed to ensure the latest information
- **Structured Format**: All content is converted to Markdown for consistent processing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes official documentation, code examples, and community discussions
- **Optimized for AI**: Designed specifically for AI tools, chatbots, and RAG pipelines
- **Output Options**:
  - `all_merged.md`: Complete content
  - `essentials_merged.md`: Streamlined version only including official documentation and sample codes.
  - `cadence_docs_merged.md`: Streamlined version only including Cadence related documentation and sample codes.
