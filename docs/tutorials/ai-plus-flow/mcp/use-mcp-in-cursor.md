# Use Flow MCP in Cursor

Adding Flow MCP to Cursor gives you powerful AI-driven tools directly inside your code editor. It allows Cursor's AI to understand, query, and interact with Flow blockchain data and smart contracts through a standard protocol called the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Specifically, it enables you to:

- Ask the AI in Cursor to fetch on-chain data such as account balances, account information, or contract source code without leaving your editor.
- Speed up development by letting AI perform blockchain queries that would normally require manual steps.
- Improve context for AI assistance by allowing Cursor to pull real blockchain data when needed.
- Automate routine Flow tasks using tools exposed by the MCP server.
- Prototype and debug faster with direct access to live blockchain information.

This tutorial will guide you through setting up and using Flow MCP in [Cursor] to enhance your Flow blockchain development experience with AI assistance.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Configure Cursor to connect with the Flow MCP server using the MCP protocol.
- Install and launch the Flow MCP server locally through Cursor.
- Identify when Flow MCP tools are successfully loaded and ready inside Cursor.
- Use Flow MCP tools to retrieve blockchain data such as account balances, account details, and contract source code.
- Troubleshoot common setup and connectivity issues between Cursor and Flow MCP.

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor] - the AI code editor
- [Flow MCP GitHub Repository] - the Flow MCP server repository

## Installation

1. Open Cursor Settings and go to the "MCP" tab.

2. Configure the MCP configuration file in Cursor:

   The MCP configuration file is located at the following location based on your operating system:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/mcp.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/mcp.json`

   Add the following configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "flow-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@outblock/flow-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Cursor to load the new MCP configuration.

   You need to wait for the MCP server to start. Once it's ready, you will see there will be a green spot in the left side of `flow-mcp` server name label and all tools for Flow MCP will be displayed.
