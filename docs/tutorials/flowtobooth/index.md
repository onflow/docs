# FlowtoBooth Tutorials

The FlowtoBooth tutorial series teaches you how to build a fun benchmark application that showcase Flow's unique capabilities, particularly its efficient gas pricing that makes traditionally expensive operations practical and affordable.

These tutorials are designed to inspire developers by demonstrating what's possible on Flow, though they may not always represent production best practices.
