# FCL Ethereum Provider

Exposes a client-side [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible Ethereum provider that uses an FCL-authenticated Cadence Owned Account (COA) under the hood.
If a wallet does not natively provide EVM capabilities, this provider emulates Ethereum JSON-RPC by delegating to FCL for signing and COA interactions.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @onflow/fcl-ethereum-provider
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"
import { createEthereumProvider } from "@onflow/fcl-ethereum-provider"

// Configure FCL (pointing to whichever Flow network you require)
fcl.config({
  "accessNode.api": "https://rest-testnet.onflow.org",
  "discovery.wallet": "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn",
})

// Create the EIP-1193 provider
const provider = createEthereumProvider({
  // Optional configuration:
  // service?: Service        // Custom FCL service config
  // gateway?: Eip1193Provider | string // EVM Gateway provider or URL
})

// Example: request EVM-style accounts (COA addresses)
const accounts = await provider.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" })
console.log("EVM Accounts:", accounts)

// Use the same session to sign a message
const signature = await provider.request({
  method: "personal_sign",
  params: ["0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64", accounts[0]], // hex-encoded "hello world"
})
console.log("Signature:", signature)

// Or send transactions
const txHash = await provider.request({
  method: "eth_sendTransaction",
  params: [
    {
      from: accounts[0],
      to: "0x1234...",
      data: "0xabcd1234...",
      value: "0x0",
    },
  ],
})
console.log("Transaction Hash:", txHash)
```

## API

### `createEthereumProvider(config?: CreateEthereumProviderConfig): Eip1193Provider`

- **Parameters**
    - `config.service?: Service`  
      An [FCL “Service” object][fcl-service-docs] for custom FCL authentication flows. If omitted, the default FCL discovery service is used.
    - `config.gateway?: Eip1193Provider | string`  
      An EIP-1193 provider (or a string URL) pointing to a Flow EVM gateway. Defaults to the public Flow EVM gateway if omitted.

- **Returns**: An [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) provider instance you can pass into EVM tooling or interact with directly in your app.

## Supported JSON-RPC Methods

Below are the main request methods handled within the FCL Ethereum provider:

1. **`eth_requestAccounts` / `eth_accounts`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Invokes the FCL authentication flow (if not already authenticated)
        - Returns the Cadence-Owned Account (COA) address
        - Stores the COA at `/storage/evm` (creates if missing)

2. **`eth_sendTransaction`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Wraps the transaction in a Cadence transaction that invokes `coa.call(...)` in the Flow EVM
        - Uses the user’s authenticated COA for signing
        - Returns the resulting EVM transaction hash

3. **`personal_sign`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Requests a user signature via FCL’s `signUserMessage` or equivalent mechanism
        - Returns an RLP-encoded [COA ownership proof](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/blob/master/fvm/evm/types/proof.go#L139) in place of a raw secp256k1 signature

5. **`eth_chainId`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Returns the numeric Flow EVM chain ID (e.g., `0x747` for Flow EVM Mainnet)

6. **`wallet_switchEthereumChain`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Allows dApps to request switching to a different Flow EVM chain (e.g. testnet to mainnet).
        - Under the hood, this can trigger reconfiguration of FCL for a different Flow access node and Flow EVM gateway if recognized.
        - If the requested chain ID is not recognized, the call will throw an error (matching EIP-1193 standard error codes).

7. **`wallet_addEthereumChain`**
    - **Behavior**:
        - Allows a dApp to request adding a Flow EVM chain config.
        - If the chain is recognized by the provider or is one the provider can handle, it will register it. Otherwise, it may reject with an EIP-1193 error.
        - Since Flow EVM is typically a single chain per environment, usage is limited. However, in principle, custom EVM networks or local dev can be added if your provider/gateway supports them.

### Fallback Behavior

Any unknown or unsupported request methods will be proxied to the `gateway` (if you provided a standard JSON-RPC URL or EIP-1193 provider). If the gateway does not handle them, an error will be returned.

## Provider Events

- **`connect`**: Emitted once the user successfully authenticates via FCL, indicating that the provider is ready.
- **`disconnect`**: Emitted if the FCL session ends or user explicitly logs out, severing the session.
- **`accountsChanged`**: Emitted when the current user changes (e.g. re-authentication, or switching user in the wallet).
- **`chainChanged`**: Emitted when the user switches to a different Flow EVM chain (e.g. testnet to mainnet).
