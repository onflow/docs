# FCL Wagmi Adapter

Provides a **Wagmi** connector that uses **@onflow/fcl-ethereum-provider** under the hood, allowing you to integrate Flow-based Cadence-Owned Accounts (COAs) seamlessly into Wagmi applications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @onflow/fcl-wagmi-adapter
```

## Usage

**Basic Example**:

```ts
import { createClient, configureChains } from 'wagmi'
import { fclWagmiConnector } from '@onflow/fcl-wagmi-adapter'
import { flowTestnet } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public'
import * as fcl from '@onflow/fcl'

// Configure FCL for Flow
fcl.config({
  "accessNode.api": "https://rest-testnet.onflow.org",
  "discovery.wallet": "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn",
})

// Set up Wagmi for Flow Testnet
const { chains, provider } = configureChains(
  [flowTestnet],
  [publicProvider()]
)

// Create a connector that uses FCL under the hood
const fclConnector = fclWagmiConnector({
  // optional: you can pass any config your provider or FCL needs
})

// Create the Wagmi client
const wagmiClient = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [fclConnector],
  provider,
})

// The rest of your dApp logic...
```

## API

### `fclWagmiConnector(options?: FclWagmiConnectorOptions): Connector`

- **Parameters**
    - `options?: object` – any additional configuration for the underlying FCL provider (gateway URL, custom FCL service, etc.)
- **Returns**: A Wagmi `Connector` object that can be used in `createClient` or `getDefaultConfig`.

**Notes**:
- This connector essentially wraps `@onflow/fcl-ethereum-provider` as an EIP-1193 provider to talk to Flow EVM via Wagmi.
- The user’s authenticated COA is exposed as the “account” in Wagmi context.
