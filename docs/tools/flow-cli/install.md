The Flow CLI can be installed on macOS, Windows (7 or greater) and most Linux systems.

## macOS

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install flow-cli
```

### From a pre-built binary

_This installation method only works on x86-64._

This script downloads and installs the appropriate binary for your system:

```sh
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onflow/flow-cli/master/install.sh)"
```

To update, simply re-run the installation command above.

It is currently not possible to install earlier versions of the Flow CLI with Homebrew.

### Install a specific version

To install a specific version of Flow CLI newer than v0.42.0, append the version tag to the command (e.g. the command below installs CLI version v0.44.0).
