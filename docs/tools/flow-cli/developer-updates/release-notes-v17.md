## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Install or Upgrade

Follow the [Flow CLI installation guide](../install.md) for instructions on how to install or upgrade the CLI.

## üí• Breaking Changes

### Configuration Format

The default configuration format (i.e. the contents of `flow.json`) has been updated.
It is now unified to work with all CLI commands. 
The new format is not backwards compatible with the old format.

If needed, you can generate a new configuration file with the `flow init` command.

Read more about the new configuration format in the [documentation](../configuration.md).

### Updated: `flow blocks get`

The `--latest`, `--id` and `--height` have been removed.

Instead, use the new argument syntax:

```sh
# get latest block
flow blocks get latest

# get a block by ID
flow blocks get 6bb0e0fceef9225a3cf9ceb6df9a31bd0063e6ee8e8dd7fdd93b831783243cd3

# get a block by height
flow blocks get 28329914
```

Read more about this change in the [documentation](../get-blocks.md).

### Removed: `flow keys decode`

The `flow keys decode` command has been temporarily removed due to a bug that requires further investigation.

### Removed: `flow keys save`

The `flow keys save` command has been removed in favour of an upcoming `flow accounts add` command.

## ‚≠ê Features

### Output

Output format was changed, so it stays consistent between commands. New flags were introduced 
that control the output. Let's take a quick look at the new flags, but make sure to read 
more about them in the documentation on each command:

- Output: `--output` specify the format of the command results (JSON, inline...),
- Save: `--save` specify the filename where you want the result to be saved,
- Log: `--log` control how much output you want to see during command execution,
- Filter: `--filter` Specify any property name from the result you want to return as the only value.

All the flags and their allowed values are specified 
for each command in the [documentation](../index.md).

Changed output for fetching account.

### Shared Library

You can import Flow CLI shared library from the `flowcli` package and use the functionality 
from the service layer in your own software. Codebase was divided into two components, first 
is the CLI interaction layer, and the second is the shared library component which is meant 
to be reused.

### Account Staking Info Command

New command to fetch staking info from the account was added. Read more about it in the
[documentation](../account-staking-info.md).

## üêû Bug Fixes

### Address 0x prefix

Addresses are not required to be prefixed with `0x` anymore. You can use either format, but 
due to consistency we advise using `0x` prefix with addresses represented in `hex` format.

### Project deploy error

Deploying contract provides improved error handling in case something goes wrong you 
can now read what the error was right from the commandline. 

Example of error output:
```
Deploying 2 contracts for accounts: emulator-account

‚ùå  contract Kibble is already deployed to this account. Use the --update flag to force update
‚ùå  contract KittyItemsMarket is already deployed to this account. Use the --update flag to force update
‚ùå  failed to deploy contracts

‚ùå Command Error: failed to deploy contracts
```
