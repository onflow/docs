The Flow CLI provides a command to run Cadence tests. 

```shell
flow test /path/to/test_script.cdc
```

⚠️ The `test` command expects configuration to be initialized. See [flow init](./initialize-configuration.md) command.

## Example Usage

A simple Cadence script `test_script.cdc`, which has a test case for running a cadence script on-chain:
```cadence
import Test

pub fun testSimpleScript() {
    var blockchain = Test.newEmulatorBlockchain()
    var result = blockchain.executeScript(
        "pub fun main(a: Int, b: Int): Int { return a + b }",
        [2, 3]
    )
    
    assert(result.status == Test.ResultStatus.succeeded)
    assert((result.returnValue! as! Int) == 5)
}
```
Above test-script can be run with the CLI as follows, and the test results will be printed on the console.
```shell
> flow test test_script.cdc

Running tests...

Test results: "test_script.cdc"
- PASS: testSimpleScript

```

To learn more about writing tests in Cadence, have a look at the [Cadence testing framework](../../cadence/testing-framework.mdx).

## Flags

### Coverage

- Flag: `--cover`
- Default: `false`

Use the `cover` flag to calculate coverage report for the code being tested.
```shell
> flow test --cover test_script.cdc

Running tests...

Test results: "test_script.cdc"
- PASS: testSimpleScript
Coverage: 100.0% of statements

```

### Coverage Report File

- Flag: `--coverprofile`
- Valid inputs: valid filename
- Default: `coverage.json`

Use the `coverprofile` to specify the filename where the calculated coverage report is to be written.
