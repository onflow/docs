---

The Access API is implemented as a [gRPC service](https://grpc.io/).

A language-agnostic specification for this API is defined using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which can be used to generate client libraries in a variety of programming languages.

- [Flow Access API protobuf source files](https://github.com/onflow/flow/tree/master/protobuf)

## Flow Access Node Endpoints

| Network | GRPC                                   | Web GRPC             | REST                      |

## Scripts

### ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock

`ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock` executes a read-only Cadence script against the latest sealed execution state.

```proto
rpc ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight (ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeightRequest) returns (ExecuteScriptResponse)
```

#### Request

Events can be requested for a specific sealed block range via the `start_height` and `end_height` (inclusive) fields and further filtered by event type via the `type` field.

If `start_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return an error.

If `end_height` is greater than the current sealed chain height, then this method will return events up to and including the latest sealed block.

The event results are grouped by block, with each group specifying a block ID, height and block timestamp.

Event types are name-spaced with the address of the account and contract in which they are declared.

#### Request

```proto
message GetEventsForHeightRangeRequest {
  string type
  uint64 start_height = 2;
  uint64 end_height = 3;
  entities.EventEncodingVersion event_encoding_version = 4;

    bytes block_id = 1;
    uint64 block_height = 2;
    repeated entities.Event events = 3;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 4;
  }

  string type = 1;
  repeated bytes block_ids = 2;
  entities.EventEncodingVersion event_encoding_version = 3;

### Account

An account is a user's identity on Flow. It contains a unique address, a balance, a list of public keys and the code that has been deployed to the account.

```proto
message Account {
  bytes address = 1;
  uint64 balance = 2;
  bytes code = 3;
  repeated AccountKey keys = 4;
  map<string, bytes> contracts = 5;
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                                 |

#### Account Key

An account key is a reference to a public key associated with a Flow account. Accounts can be configured with zero or more public keys, each of which can be used for signature verification when authorizing a transaction.

  bytes public_key = 2;
  uint32 sign_algo = 3;
  uint32 hash_algo = 4;

More information on account keys, key weights and sequence numbers can be found [here](../../../../../build/basics/accounts.md).

### Event

## Subscriptions

### SubscribeEvents

`SubscribeEvents` streams events for all blocks starting at the requested start block, up until the latest available block. Once the latest is
reached, the stream will remain open and responses are sent for each new block as it becomes available.

Events within each block are filtered by the provided [EventFilter](#eventfilter), and only those events that match the filter are returned. If no filter is provided,
all events are returned.

Responses are returned for each block containing at least one event that matches the filter. Additionally, heatbeat responses (SubscribeEventsResponse
with no events) are returned periodically to allow clients to track which blocks were searched. Clients can use this information to determine
which block to start from when reconnecting.

```proto
rpc SubscribeEvents(SubscribeEventsRequest) returns (stream SubscribeEventsResponse)
```

#### Request

```proto
message SubscribeEventsRequest {
  bytes start_block_id = 1;

## Execution data

### EventFilter

`EventFilter` defines the filter to apply to block events. Filters are applied as an OR operation, i.e. any event matching any of the filters is returned.
If no filters are provided, all events are returned. If there are any invalid filters, the API will return an InvalidArgument error.

```proto
message EventFilter {
  repeated string event_type = 1;
  repeated string contract = 2;
  repeated string address = 3;
}
```

| contract   | A list of contracts who's events should be included. Contracts have the following name formats:<br/> _ Protocol events: `flow`<br/> _ Smart contract events: `A.[contract address].[contract name]`<br/> This filter matches on the full contract including its address, not just the contract's name |
| address    | A list of addresses who's events should be included. Addresses must be Flow account addresses in hex format and valid for the network the node is connected to. i.e. only a mainnet address is valid for a mainnet node. Addresses may optionally include the `0x` prefix                             |


## Execution data streaming API

### Execution Data API

The `ExecutionDataAPI` provides access to block execution data over gRPC, including transactions, events, and register data (account state). It’s an optional API, which makes use of the Execution Sync protocol to trustlessly download data from peers on the network.

[execution data protobuf file](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/protobuf/flow/executiondata/executiondata.proto)


> The API is disabled by default. To enable it, specify a listener address with the cli flag `--state-stream-addr`.


<aside>
ℹ️ Currently, the api must be started on a separate port from the regular gRPC endpoint. There is work underway to add support for using the same port.

</aside>

Below is a list of the available CLI flags to control the behavior of the API

| Flag                             | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Default is 1000 for each.                                                                                                 |
| state-stream-send-timeout        | duration | Maximum wait before timing out while sending a response to a streaming client. Default is 30s.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| state-stream-send-buffer-size    | uint     | Maximum number of unsent responses to buffer for a stream. Default is 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| state-stream-response-limit      | float64  | Max number of responses per second to send over streaming endpoints. This effectively applies a rate limit to responses to help manage resources consumed by each client. This is mostly used when clients are querying data past data. e.g. 3 or 0.5. Default is 0 which means no limit. |

ℹ️ This API provides access to Execution Data, which can be very large (100s of MB) for a given block. Given the large amount of data, operators should consider their expected usage patters and tune the available settings to limit the resources a single client can use. It may also be useful to use other means of managing traffic, such as reverse proxies or QoS tools.
