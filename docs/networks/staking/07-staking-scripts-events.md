# Introduction

The staking contract stores a lot of different state, and the state is constantly changing.
As an external party, there are two ways to keep track of these state changes. 
You can either use Cadence scripts to query the state of the contract at any given time,
or you can monitor events that are emitted by the staking contract to be notified of any important occurances.

# Query Information with Scripts

## Get the list of proposed nodes for the next epoch:

`FlowIDTableStaking.getProposedNodeIDs()`: Returns an array of node IDs for proposed nodes.
Proposed nodes are nodes that have enough staked and committed for the next epoch
to be above the minimum requirement and have been selected to participate in the next epoch.
This means that new access nodes that have not been selected with the random slot selection algorithm
will not be included in this list.

You can use the **Get Proposed Table**([SC.05](../../build/core-contracts/06-staking-contract-reference.md#getting-staking-info)) script for retrieving this info.

This script requires no arguments.

## Get the list of all nodes that are currently staked:

`FlowIDTableStaking.getStakedNodeIDs()` and ``FlowIDTableStaking.getParticipantNodeList()`:
Returns an array of nodeIDs that are currently staked.
Staked nodes are nodes that are staked and participating in the current epoch.

You can use the **Get Current Table**([SC.04](../../build/core-contracts/06-staking-contract-reference.md#getting-staking-info)) script for retrieving this info.

This script requires no arguments.

## Get the list of all Candidate Nodes

`getCandidateNodeList(): {UInt8: {String: Bool}}`:
Returns a dictionary of nodes that are candidates to stake in the next epoch
but are not staked in the current epoch.

# Staking Events

Staking events can be queried using the Go or JavaScript SDKs to extract useful notifications and information about the
state of the staking process.

## Global Staking and Epoch Events

### NewEpoch

Emitted by `FlowIDTableStaking.Admin.setEpochTokenPayout()` when the Admin changes the total tokens paid at the end of the epoch.

After this event the `epochTokenPayout` is equal to the new value.

## Node Events

These are events that concern the operation of a node.
