The following bridges offer cross-chain swaps (token bridging including swap) to or from Flow EVM. 

## Liquidity Pool Based Cross-chain Swaps 

### Stargate

[Stargate](https://stargate.finance) employs unified liquidity pools shared across multiple chains to enable native asset transfers and cross-chain swaps 
without wrapped tokens. It is built on LayerZero's cross-chain messaging protocol.

### Celer

[Celer](https://cbridge.celer.network) is a hybrid liquidity network bridge that combines multiple bridging models and is based on the Celer 
Inter-Chain Messaging Framework.

## Intent Based Cross-chain Swaps

Intent based bridges do not depend on pre-funded liquidity pools which can improve user experience, transaction speed and capital efficiency.

### Relay

[Relay.link](https://relay.link/bridge/base) allows users to specify desired cross-chain swap outcomes for orders.

### DeBridge

[DeBridge](https://app.debridge.finance/) achieves efficient cross-chain swaps with minimal slippage in a decentralized environment 
through a peer-to-peer transaction mechanism.
