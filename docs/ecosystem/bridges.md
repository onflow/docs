# Bridges

Bridges are mechanisms that connect different blockchain networks, enabling secure and decentralized transfers of assets and data across various platforms.

<div id="cards" className="cards">

## Celer cBridge

[Celer cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/) is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge that supports more than 150 tokens across over 40 blockchains and layer-2 rollups. It is built on top of the [Celer](https://celer.network/) Inter-chain Message Framework. cBridge has facilitated over $13 billion in cross-chain asset transfer volume across 40+ blockchains for more than 350,000 unique users. It is rapidly growing and expanding to support more blockchains and layer-2 solutions.

## Axelar

[Axelar](https://www.axelar.network/) is a decentralized cross-chain network connecting over 55 blockchains, facilitating asset transfers and smart contract programmability. It features a proof-of-stake consensus for security and supports cross-chain applications through General Message Passing (GMP). Integrations with platforms like [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/) enable easy token swaps across networks like Ethereum and Polygon.

## LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://docs.layerzero.network/) is a decentralized omnichain interoperability protocol that enables direct cross-chain messaging and asset transfers. It uses a unique Ultra Light Node (ULN) architecture combined with decentralized verifiers to ensure secure message delivery across chains. LayerZero supports multiple EVM-compatible chains and provides developers with tools to build cross-chain applications through its EndpointV2 contracts.

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://www.usenexus.org/) is a modular interoperability framework that enables secure cross-chain communication. It allows developers to build applications that can seamlessly interact across different blockchain networks. Hyperlane's architecture emphasizes security and flexibility, providing customizable security models and permissionless interoperability between any blockchain networks.
