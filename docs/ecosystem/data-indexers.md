# Data Indexers

When building applications that leverage Flow data, developers have multiple Data Indexers to choose from. These platforms offer flexible options, allowing you to index all data on Flow, including information from both the Cadence VM and EVM. Alternatively, if your application doesn't require Cadence, you can opt to index only EVM data. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor your data indexing strategy to fit the specific needs of your application.
