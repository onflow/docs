</FAQ>

<FAQ question="Does my application have to be 100% Flow-based?">
No, but it should leverage Flow in a significant way. This will be up to the discretion of the reviewers, but you can get in touch if you're unsure about your project's eligibility.
</FAQ>

<FAQ question="Does my application have to be live?">
