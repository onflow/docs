# Flow Ecosystem Grant Programs

The Flow Foundation provides grants to support developers and teams building tools and products that enhance the Flow ecosystem.

## Focus Areas

We are particularly interested in projects across these key areas:

- ðŸ“ˆ **DeFi**: Innovative decentralized finance solutions
- ðŸ’¡ **Cutting-Edge Innovation and Widespread Adoption**: Projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the Flow ecosystem
- ðŸ’¼ **Public Goods**: Projects that provide essential infrastructure or services to the Flow ecosystem

## How to Apply

We have two grant programs for different types of projects:

- ðŸŒ± **GrantDAO Program**: For pre-startup or post-hackathon projects, with a focus on building on Flow. This is a community-driven program and the grantees are voted on by the community.
- ðŸ’¡ **Ecosystem Grants**: For startup projects that are looking for funding to support their growth. This is a top-down program and the Flow Foundation will evaluate the grant applications.

### GrantDAO Program

The Flow GrantDAO is allocating over several million FLOW to ecosystem builders. Eligible projects can be awarded up to 50k FLOW per round. Flow GrantDAO gives teams an opportunity to secure funding while working on bringing their project to life and solving real problems. After completing an application and getting approved, projects are funded based on community MACI voting. Voting happens throughout the round and payouts occur at the end of the round period.

Projects that graduate from this program and show strong signs of traction or utilization may be offered additional startup advisory support from the Flow Foundation as well as fundraising opportunities and training.

1. Visit the [Flow GrantDAO](https://dorahacks.io/flow) website
2. Submit an application of your BUIDL
3. Wait for the results of the round. If selected, you will be funded

### Ecosystem Grants

The ecosystem grants program is aimed at supporting the growth of Flow ecosystem projects. The Flow Foundation will evaluate the grant applications and select the grantees.

1. Please make a proposal and clearly describe your project. Include:
    - A milestone-based roadmap, and a clear timeline for each milestone
    - The amount of funding you are requesting for each milestone
    - How you will use the funding
    - How you will measure the success of the project
2. Send the proposal to Flow Foundation at [bd@flowfoundation.org](mailto:bd@flowfoundation.org)
3. Wait for our response for your proposal, our BD team will get back to you as soon as possible.
