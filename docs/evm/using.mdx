# Using EVM On Flow

## EVM Wallets

Applications deployed to EVM on Flow will work with popular EVM-compatible wallets such as [MetaMask](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), all you need to do is add the correct [RPC endpoint](./networks) as a custom network.

### [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)

<BrowserOnly>
{() => {
    // ******* If Chain Id changes, update the Chain ID in the AddNetworkButton component *******
    return <AddNetworkButton />;
}}
</BrowserOnly>
Manual method: Add EVM on Flow as a custom network to MetaMask:

1. Open the MetaMask browser extension
2. Open the network selection dropdown menu by clicking the dropdown button at the top of the extension
3. Click the **`Add network`** button
4. Click **`Add a network manually`**
5. In the **`Add a network manually`** dialog that appears, enter the following information for [Previewnet](https://developers.flow.com/networks/flow-networks/accessing-previewnet):

| Name            | Value                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Network Name    | Flow Previewnet                      |
| Description     | The public RPC url for Flow Previewnet  |
| RPC Endpoint    | https://previewnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org |
| Chain ID        | 646                                     |
| Currency Symbol | FLOW                                    |
| Block Explorer  | https://previewnet.flowdiver.io          |

6. Tap the Save button to save Flow Previewnet as a network.

You should now be able to connect to the EVM on Flow by selecting it from the network selection dropdown menu.

Use the [Flow Previewnet Faucet](https://previewnet-faucet.onflow.org/fund-account) to fund a new account for testing.

## Flow Native Wallets

## EVM Specification

- Flow EVM is a virtual EVM-based blockchain on Flow using the latest EVM byte-code interpreter `Geth v1.13`
- Utilizes `FLOW` token for transactions, with balances denominated in `Atto-FLOW` (1 `FLOW` = 10^18 `Atto-FLOW`)
- Offers a gateway that exposes the standard EVM API (Ethereum JSON-RPC)
- Read more about the implementation in [FLIP 223: EVM integration interface](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20231116-evm-support.md)
