# Web3.js

[Web3.js](https://web3js.org/) is a Javascript library for building on EVM-compatible networks.

It allows developers to interact with smart contracts, send transactions, and retrieve data from the network.

## Prerequisites

:::info
This guide assumes you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
:::

To install `web3` in your project, run the following command:

```sh
npm install web3
```

## Initializing Web3 with Flow

To use `web3` in your project, start by importing the module and initializing your `Web3` instance with a Flow RPC endpoint.

```js
const { Web3 } = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org');
```

**Note:** If you want to connect to the Flow testnet, replace the above URL with `https://mainnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org`.

## Querying The Blockchain

`web3` provides a number of methods for querying the blockchain, such as getting the latest block number, querying account balances, and more.

You can try using some of these methods to verify that your `web3` instance is working correctly.

```js
// Get the latest block number
const blockNumber = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();
console.log(blockNumber); // Latest block number

// Get the balance of an account
const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance('0x1234'); // Replace with any address
console.log(balance); // Balance in attoFlow

// Get the chain ID
const chainId = await web3.eth.getChainId();
console.log(chainId);

// Get the gas price
const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
console.log(gasPrice); // Gas price in attoFlow
```

For more information about other queries you can make `web3`, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.web3js.org/).

## Interacting with Smart Contracts

The `web3` library allows developers to interact with smart contracts via the `web3.eth.Contract` API.

For this example we will use the following `Storage` contract.

We recommend deploying your own contract, which can be done using [Hardhat](../guides/hardhat.md) or [Remix](../guides/remix.md).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Storage {
    uint256 public storedData;

    function store(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

The ABI for this contract can be generated using the [`solc` compiler](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html), or another tool such as [Hardhat](../guides/hardhat.md) or [Remix](../guides/remix.md).

Now that we have both the ABI and address of the contract, we can create a new `Contract` object for use in our application.

```js
// Replace with the ABI of the deployed contract
const abi = [
  {
    inputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
    type: 'constructor',
  },
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'x',
        type: 'uint256',
      },
    ],
    name: 'store',
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
    type: 'function',
  },
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: 'retrieve',
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: '',
        type: 'uint256',
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: 'view',
    type: 'function',
  },
];

// Replace with the address of the deployed contract
const contractAddress = '0x4c7784ae96e7cfcf0224a95059573e96f03a4e70';

// Create a new contract object with the ABI and address
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
```

We can now interact with the contract on the network by using the `contract` object.

### Reading State

State can be read from the contract by using the `call` function with one of the contract's methods. This will not change the state and will not send a transaction.

```js
// Retrieve the current value stored in the contract
// (this is using the `retrieve` method from the contract with no arguments)
const result = await contract.methods.retrieve().call();

console.log(result); // Current value stored in the contract
```

### Changing State

We can mutate the state of the contract by sending a transaction to the network.

In order to send a transaction to the network, you will need an account with sufficient funds to pay for the transaction.

:::info
If you do not have an account yet, you can create one using the following command from your project's root directory:

```sh
node -e "console.log(require('web3').eth.accounts.create())"
```

Note that this is not a secure way to generate an account, and you should use a more secure method in a production environment.

You can fund your account using the [Flow Faucet](https://faucet.flow.com/fund-account).
:::

We can use the `privateKeyToAccount` function to create an `Web3Account` object from our account's private key.

```js
// You must replace this with the private key of the account you wish to use
const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount('0x1234');
```

Then, we can sign a transaction using the user's account and send it to the network.

```js
const newValue = 1337; // Replace with any value you want to store

// Sign a transaction that stores a new value in the contract
// (this is using the `store` method from the contract with the new value as an argument)
let signed = await account.signTransaction({
  from: account.address,
  to: contractAddress,
  data: contract.methods.store(newValue).encodeABI(),
  gas: 10000000n, // Replace with the gas limit you want to use
  gasPrice: await web3.eth.getGasPrice(), // Replace with the gas price you want to use
});

// Send signed transaction to the network
const result = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signed.rawTransaction);

// { status: 1, transactionHash: '0x1234', ... }
// status=1 means the transaction was successful
console.log(result);
```

Now that the transaction has been sent, the contract's state should have been updated. We can verify this by querying the contract's state again:

```js
const result = await contract.methods.retrieve().call();
console.log(result); // New value stored in the contract
```
