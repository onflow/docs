# Using Foundry with Flow

Foundry is a suite of development tools that simplifies the process of developing and deploying Solidity contracts to EVM networks. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a Solidity contract to Flow EVM using the Foundry development toolchain. You can check out the official Foundry docs [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

In this guide, we'll deploy an ERC-20 token contract to Flow EVM using Foundry. We'll cover:

- Developing and testing a basic ERC-20 contract
- Deploying the contract to Flow EVM using Foundry tools
- Querying Testnet state
- Mutating Testnet state by sending transactions

## Overview

To use Flow across all Foundry tools you need to:

1. Provide the Flow EVM RPC URL to the command you are using:

   ```shell
   --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org
   ```

2. Use the `--legacy` flag to disable [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) style transactions. Flow will support EIP-1559 soon and this flag won't be needed.

As an example, we'll show you how to deploy a fungible token contract to Flow EVM using Foundry. You will see how the above flags are used in practice.

## Example: Deploying an ERC-20 Token Contract to Flow EVM

ERC-20 tokens are the most common type of tokens on Ethereum. We'll use [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) starter templates with Foundry on Flow Testnet to deploy our own token called `MyToken`.

### Installation

The best way to install Foundry, is to use the `foundryup` CLI tool. You can get it using the following command:

```shell
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Install the tools:

```shell
foundryup
```

This will install the Foundry tool suite: `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`.

You may need to reload your shell after `foundryup` installation.

Check out the official [Installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) guide for more information about different platforms or installing specific versions.

### Wallet Setup

We first need to generate a key pair for our EVM account. We can do this using the `cast` tool:

```shell
cast wallet new
```

`cast` will print the private key and address of the new account. We can then paste the account address into the [Faucet](https://faucet.flow.com/fund-account) to fund it with some Testnet FLOW tokens.

You can verify the balance of the account after funding. Replace `$YOUR_ADDRESS` with the address of the account you funded:

```shell
cast balance --ether --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org $YOUR_ADDRESS
```

### Project Setup

First, create a new directory for your project:

```shell
mkdir mytoken
cd mytoken
```

We can use `init` to initialize a new project:

```shell
forge init
```

This will create a contract called `Counter` in the `contracts` directory with associated tests and deployment scripts. We can replace this with our own ERC-20 contract. To verify the initial setup, you can run the tests for `Counter`:

```shell
forge test
```

The tests should pass.

### Writing the ERC-20 Token Contract

We'll use the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 contract template. We can start by adding OpenZeppelin to our project:

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

Rename `src/Counter.sol` to `src/MyToken.sol` and replace the contents with the following:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialMint_) ERC20("MyToken", "MyT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialMint_);
    }
}
```

The above is a basic ERC-20 token with the name `MyToken` and symbol `MyT`. It also mints the specified amount of tokens to the contract deployer. The amount is passed as a constructor argument during deployment.

Before compiling, we also need to update the test file.

### Testing

Rename `test/Counter.t.sol` to `test/MyToken.t.sol` and replace the contents with the following:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {Test, console2, stdError} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {MyToken} from "../src/MyToken.sol";

contract MyTokenTest is Test {
    uint256 initialSupply = 420000;

    MyToken public token;
    address ownerAddress = makeAddr("owner");
    address randomUserAddress = makeAddr("user");

    function setUp() public {
        vm.prank(ownerAddress);
        token = new MyToken(initialSupply);
    }

    /*
        Test general ERC-20 token properties
    */
    function test_tokenProps() public view {
        assertEq(token.name(), "MyToken");
        assertEq(token.symbol(), "MyT");
        assertEq(token.decimals(), 18);
        assertEq(token.totalSupply(), initialSupply);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(0)), 0);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(ownerAddress), initialSupply);
    }

    /*
        Test Revert transfer to sender with insufficient balance
    */
    function test_transferRevertInsufficientBalance() public {
        vm.prank(randomUserAddress);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("ERC20InsufficientBalance(address,uint256,uint256)", randomUserAddress, 0, 42));
        token.transfer(ownerAddress, 42);
    }

    /*
        Test transfer
    */
    function test_transfer() public {
        vm.prank(ownerAddress);
        assertEq(token.transfer(randomUserAddress, 42), true);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(randomUserAddress), 42);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(ownerAddress), initialSupply - 42);
    }

    /*
        Test transferFrom with approval
    */
    function test_transferFrom() public {
        vm.prank(ownerAddress);
        token.approve(randomUserAddress, 69);

        uint256 initialRandomUserBalance = token.balanceOf(randomUserAddress);
        uint256 initialOwnerBalance = token.balanceOf(ownerAddress);

        vm.prank(randomUserAddress);
        assertEq(token.transferFrom(ownerAddress, randomUserAddress, 42), true);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(randomUserAddress), initialRandomUserBalance + 42);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(ownerAddress), initialOwnerBalance - 42);
        assertEq(token.allowance(ownerAddress, randomUserAddress), 69 - 42);
    }
}
```

You can now make sure everything is okay by compiling the contracts:

```shell
forge compile
```

Run the tests:

```shell
forge test
```

They should all succeed.

### Deploying to Flow Testnet

We can now deploy `MyToken` using the `forge create` command. We need to provide the RPC URL, private key from a funded account using the faucet, and constructor arguments that is the initial mint amount in this case. We need to use the `--legacy` flag to disable EIP-1559 style transactions. Replace `$DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` with the private key of the account you created earlier:

```shell
forge create --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --constructor-args 42000000 \
    --legacy \
    src/MyToken.sol:MyToken
```

The above will print the deployed contract address. We'll use it in the next section to interact with the contract.

### Querying Testnet State

Based on the given constructor arguments, the deployer should own `42,000,000 MyT`. We can check the `MyToken` balance of the contract owner. Replace `$DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS` with the address of the deployed contract and `$DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` with the address of the account you funded earlier:

```shell
cast balance \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    --erc20 $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    $DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
```

This should return the amount specified during deployment. We can also call the associated function directly in the contract:

```shell
cast call $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" \
    $DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
```

We can query other data like the token symbol:

```shell
cast call $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    "symbol()(string)"
```

### Sending Transactions

Let's create a second account and move some tokens using a transaction. You can use `cast wallet new` to create a new test account. You don't need to fund it to receive tokens. Replace `$NEW_ADDRESS` with the address of the new account:

```shell
cast send $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
    --legacy \
    "transfer(address,uint256)(bool)" \
    $NEW_ADDRESS 42
```

We can check the balance of the new account:

```shell
cast balance \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    --erc20 $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    $NEW_ADDRESS
```

The deployer should also own less tokens now:

```shell
cast balance \
    --rpc-url https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org \
    --erc20 $DEPLOYED_MYTOKEN_ADDRESS \
    $DEPLOYER_ADDRESS
```
