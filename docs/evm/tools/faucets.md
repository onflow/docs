# Faucets

A faucet is a way to distribute small amounts of a token to users for testing and development purposes.
Token faucets are essential for developers to test and deploy smart contracts without using real assets.

If you would like to run your EVM app on Flow Previewnet or Testnet you must fund it with some FLOW using a faucet or supporting wallet.

## Flow Faucet

The Flow Faucet is a fast and reliable network faucet that allows you to create an account on the specified network as well as fund small amounts of test Flow to any Cadence or EVM address on these networks.
