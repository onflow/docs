# Faucets

A faucet is a way to distribute small amounts of a token to users for testing and development purposes.
Token faucets are essential for developers to test and deploy smart contracts without using real assets.

## Previewnet

The Crescendo Previewnet network, part of the Flow ecosystem, also offers a faucet for developers. Access the Crescendo Previewnet faucet at: [Previewnet Faucet](https://previewnet-faucet.onflow.org/fund-account)

## Testnet (FlowEVM Support Coming Soon)

FlowEVM supports developers with a testnet faucet, facilitating the testing and development of smart contracts in a risk-free environment. Access the testnet faucet at: [FlowEVM Testnet Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/fund-account)

## Mainnet

FlowEVM does not have a faucet for mainnet. You can get FLOW token through an exchange or receiving FLOW from a 3rd party or receiving FLOW token as staking rewards. Learn more [here](https://flow.com/use-flow/flow-token).
