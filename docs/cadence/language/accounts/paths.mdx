Account storage stores objects under paths.
Paths consist of a domain and an identifier.

Paths start with the character `/`, followed by the domain, the path separator `/`,
and finally the identifier. The identifier must start with a letter and can only be followed by letters, numbers, or the underscore `_`. 
For example, the path `/storage/test` has the domain `storage` and the identifier `test`.

There are two valid domains: `storage` and `public`.

Paths in the storage domain have type `StoragePath`,
and paths in the public domain have the type `PublicPath`.
Both `StoragePath` and `PublicPath` are subtypes of `Path`.

The `storage` domain stores storable objects, such as resources and structs.
Objects stored under the `storage` domain are only accessible through account references
which are authorized with a storage entitlement.

The `public` domain stores capabilities,
which are accessible by anyone.

## Path functions

```cadence
fun toString(): String
```

Returns the string representation of the path.

```cadence
let storagePath = /storage/path

storagePath.toString()  // is "/storage/path"
```

There are also utilities to produce paths from strings:

```cadence
fun PublicPath(identifier: string): PublicPath?
fun StoragePath(identifier: string): StoragePath?
```

Each of these functions take an identifier and produce a path of the appropriate domain:

```cadence
let pathID = "foo"
let path = PublicPath(identifier: pathID) // is /public/foo
```
