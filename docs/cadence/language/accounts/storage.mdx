Accounts allow storing storable objects, such as resources and structures.

An account exposes its storage through the `storage` field,
which has the type `Account.Storage`.

## `Account.Storage`

```cadence
access(all)
struct Storage {
    /// The current amount of storage used by the account in bytes.
    access(all)
    let used: UInt64

    /// The storage capacity of the account in bytes.

    let capacity: UInt64

## Saving objects

```cadence
access(Storage | SaveValue)
fun save<T: Storable>(_ value: T, to: StoragePath)
```

The `save` function saves an object to account storage.
The function moves resources, and copies structures.
If there is already an object stored under the given path, the program aborts.
The path must be a storage path, it must have the domain `storage`.

`T` is the type parameter for the object type.
Cadence can infer this type parameter from the argument's type.

## Getting object type information

```cadence
access(all)
view fun type(at path: StoragePath): Type?
```

The `type` function returns the type of the object stored under the given path,
or `nil` if the account does not store an object under the given path.

The function does not change the stored object.

The path must be a storage path, it must have the domain `storage`.

## Removing objects

```cadence
access(Storage | LoadValue)
fun load<T: Storable>(from: StoragePath): T?
```

The `load` function loads an object from account storage.
If there is an object stored under the given path,
the function moves the stored resource or structure out of storage
and returns it as an optional.
If there is no object stored under the given path,
the function returns `nil`.
When the function returns with an object,
the storage no longer stores an object under the given path.

`T` is the type parameter for the object type.
Programs must explicitly provide a type argument for the parameter.

The type `T` must be a supertype of the type of the loaded object.
If it is not, the program aborts.
The given type does not necessarily need to be exactly the same as the type of the loaded object.

The path must be a storage path, it must have the domain `storage`.

## Copying objects

```cadence
access(Storage | CopyValue)
view fun copy<T: AnyStruct>(from: StoragePath): T?
```

The `copy` function returns a copy of a structure stored in account storage,
without removing it from storage.
If there is a structure stored under the given path,
the function copies the stored structure and returns it as an optional.
If there is no structure stored under the given path,
the function returns `nil`.
When the function returns with an object,
the structure stays stored in storage after the function returns.

`T` is the type parameter for the structure type.
Programs must explicitly provide a type argument for the parameter.

The type `T` must be a supertype of the type of the copied structure.
If it is not, the program aborts.
The given type does not necessarily have to be exactly the same as the type of the copied structure.

The path must be a storage path, it must have the domain `storage`.

## Accessing objects

```cadence
access(Storage | BorrowValue)
view fun borrow<T: &Any>(from: StoragePath): T?
```

The `borrow` function returns a reference to an objects stored in storage,
without removing the object from storage.
The function makes it convenient to work with objects in storage
without having to move them out of storage.

If there is a structure stored under the given path,
the function creates a reference to the object and returns the reference as an optional.
If there is no structure stored under the given path,
the function returns `nil`.

`T` is the type parameter for the object type.
Programs must explicitly provide a type argument for the parameter.

The type argument must be a reference to any type, `&Any` (`Any` is the supertype of all types).
The type `T` must be a supertype of the type of the borrowed object.
If it is not, the program aborts.
The given type does not necessarily have to be exactly the same as the type of the borrowed object.

The path must be a storage path, it must have the domain `storage`.

## Example

```cadence
// Declare a resource interface named `HasCount`, that has a field `count`
//
resource interface HasCount {
    count: Int
}

// Declare a resource named `Counter` that conforms to `HasCount`
//
resource Counter: HasCount {
    access(all)
    var count: Int

    access(all)
    init(count: Int) {
        self.count = count
    }
}

// In this example, an authorized reference to an account
// is available through the constant `account`.

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Counter`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
// The path `/storage/counter` is used to refer to the stored value.
// Its identifier `counter` was chosen freely and could be something else.
//
account.storage.save(
    <-create Counter(count: 42),
    to: /storage/counter
)

// Run-time error: Storage already contains an object under path `/storage/counter`
//
account.storage.save(
    <-create Counter(count: 123),
    to: /storage/counter
)

// Load the `Counter` resource from storage path `/storage/counter`.
//
// The new constant `counter` has the type `Counter?`, i.e., it is an optional,
// and its value is the counter resource, that was saved at the beginning
// of the example.
//
let counter <- account.storage.load<@Counter>(from: /storage/counter)

// The storage is now empty, there is no longer an object stored
// under the path `/storage/counter`.

// Load the `Counter` resource again from storage path `/storage/counter`.
//
// The new constant `counter2` has the type `Counter?` and is `nil`,
// as nothing is stored under the path `/storage/counter` anymore,
// because the previous load moved the counter out of storage.
//
let counter2 <- account.storage.load<@Counter>(from: /storage/counter)

// Create another new instance of the resource type `Counter`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
// The path `/storage/otherCounter` is used to refer to the stored value.
//
account.storage.save(
    <-create Counter(count: 123),
    to: /storage/otherCounter
)

// Load the `Vault` resource from storage path `/storage/otherCounter`.
//
// The new constant `vault` has the type `Vault?` and its value is `nil`,
// as there is a resource with type `Counter` stored under the path,
// which is not a subtype of the requested type `Vault`.
//
let vault <- account.storage.load<@Vault>(from: /storage/otherCounter)

// The storage still stores a `Counter` resource under the path `/storage/otherCounter`.

// Save the string "Hello, World" in storage
// under the path `/storage/helloWorldMessage`.

account.storage.save(
    "Hello, world!",
    to: /storage/helloWorldMessage
)

// Copy the stored message from storage.
//
// After the copy, the storage still stores the string under the path.
// Unlike `load`, `copy` does not remove the object from storage.
//
let message = account.storage.copy<String>(from: /storage/helloWorldMessage)

// Create a new instance of the resource type `Vault`
// and save it in the storage of the account.
//
account.storage.save(
    <-createEmptyVault(),
    to: /storage/vault
)

// Invalid: Cannot copy a resource, as this would allow arbitrary duplication.
//
let vault <- account.storage.copy<@Vault>(from: /storage/vault)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/counter`,
// typed as `&Counter`.
//
// `counterRef` has type `&Counter?` and is a valid reference, i.e. non-`nil`,
// because the borrow succeeded:
//
// There is an object stored under path `/storage/otherCounter`
// and it has type `Counter`, so it can be borrowed as `&Counter`
//
let counterRef = account.storage.borrow<&Counter>(from: /storage/otherCounter)

counterRef?.count // is `42`

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/otherCounter`,
// typed as `&{HasCount}`.
//
// `hasCountRef` is non-`nil`, as there is an object stored under path `/storage/otherCounter`,
// and the stored value of type `Counter` conforms to the requested type `{HasCount}`:
// the type `Counter` implements the intersection type's interface `HasCount`

let hasCountRef = account.storage.borrow<&{HasCount}>(from: /storage/otherCounter)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/otherCounter`,
// typed as `&{SomethingElse}`.
//
// `otherRef` is `nil`, as there is an object stored under path `/storage/otherCounter`,
// but the stored value of type `Counter` does not conform to the requested type `{SomethingElse}`:
// the type `Counter` does not implement the intersection type's interface `SomethingElse`

let otherRef = account.storage.borrow<&{SomethingElse}>(from: /storage/otherCounter)

// Create a reference to the object stored under path `/storage/nonExistent`,
// typed as `&{HasCount}`.
//
// `nonExistentRef` is `nil`, as there is nothing stored under path `/storage/nonExistent`
//
let nonExistentRef = account.storage.borrow<&{HasCount}>(from: /storage/nonExistent)
```

## Iterating over stored objects

The following functions allow iterating over an account's storage:

```cadence
fun forEachPublic(_ function: fun(PublicPath, Type): Bool)
fun forEachStored(_ function: fun(StoragePath, Type): Bool)
```

The functions iterate over all stored objects in the particular domain,
calling the callback function for each stored object,
passing the path and the run-time type of the stored object.

The `Bool` value returned from the callback function determines whether iteration continues.
If the callback function returns `true`, iteration proceeds to the next stored object.
If the callback function returns `false`, the iteration function stops.
The specific order in which the objects are iterated over is undefined,
as is the behavior when a path is added or removed from storage.

<Callout type="info">
    The iteration functions skip broken objects.

    An object could be broken due to invalid types associated with the stored value.
    For example, the contract for the stored object might have syntactic or semantic errors.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
The order of iteration is undefined. Do not rely on any particular behavior.

Saving an object to a path or loading an object from storage during iteration
can cause the order in which values are stored to change arbitrarily.

When a program continues to iterate after such an operation, the program aborts.

To avoid such errors, do not save objects to storage or load objects from storage during iteration.
If you do perform such an operation,
return `false` from the iteration callback to cause iteration to end after the mutation like so:

```cadence
account.storage.save(1, to: /storage/foo1)
account.storage.save(2, to: /storage/foo2)
account.storage.save(3, to: /storage/foo3)
account.storage.save("qux", to: /storage/foo4)

account.storage.forEachStored(fun (path: StoragePath, type: Type): Bool {
    if type == Type<String>() {
        // Save a value to storage while iterating
        account.storage.save("bar", to: /storage/foo5)

        // Returning false here ends iteration after storage is modified,
        // preventing the program from aborting
        return false
    }

    return true
})
```

</Callout>

## Storage limit

An account's storage is limited by its storage capacity.

An account's storage used is the sum of the size of all the data that the account stores, in MB.
An account's storage capacity is a value that is calculated from the amount of FLOW
that is stored in the account's main FLOW token vault.

At the end of every transaction, the storage used is compared to the storage capacity.
For all accounts involved in the transaction,
if the account's storage used is greater than its storage capacity, the transaction fails.

An account exposes its storage used through the `storage.used` field,
and its storage capacity through the `storage.capacity` field.

The fields represent current values:

```cadence
// Query the storage used before saving an object
let storageUsedBefore = account.storage.used

// Save a resource into storage
account.storage.save(
    <-create Counter(count: 123),
    to: /storage/counter
)

// Query the storage used again after saving
let storageUsedAfter = account.storage.used

let storageUsedChanged = storageUsedAfter > storageUsedBefore  // is true
```
