title: Accounts

The type `Account` provides access to accounts,
Accounts are only accessed through [references](../references.mdx),
which might be [authorized](../references.mdx#authorized-references).

Account objects provide information about and allow the management of
the accounts associated objects, like the [account storage](./storage.mdx),
[keys](./keys.mdx), [contracts](./contracts.mdx),
and [capabilities](./capabilities.mdx).

```cadence
access(all)
struct Account {

    /// The address of the account.
    access(all)
    let address: Address

    /// The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account.
    access(all)
    let balance: UFix64

    /// The FLOW balance of the default vault of this account that is available to be moved.
    access(all)
    let availableBalance: UFix64

    /// The storage of the account.
    access(AccountMapping)
    let storage: Account.Storage

    /// The contracts deployed to the account.
    access(AccountMapping)
    let contracts: Account.Contracts

    /// The keys assigned to the account.
    access(AccountMapping)
    let keys: Account.Keys

    /// The inbox allows bootstrapping (sending and receiving) capabilities.
    access(AccountMapping)
    let inbox: Account.Inbox

    /// The capabilities of the account.
    access(AccountMapping)
    let capabilities: Account.Capabilities
}

## Account access

### Performing read operations

Access to an `&Account` means having "read access" to it.
For example, the `address` and `balance` fields have the `access(all)` modifier,
so are always accessible, which is safe because this information is public,
and the fields are read-only.

Any code can get a "read-only" reference to an account (`&Account`)
for an account address by using the built-in `getAccount` function:

```cadence
fun getAccount(_ address: Address): &Account
```

### Performing write operations

Access to an authorized account reference (`auth(...) &Account`)
means having certain "write access" to it.

[Entitlements](../access-control.md#entitlements) authorize access to accounts.
Cadence provides both coarse-grained and fine-grained entitlements,
which decide what management functions are accessible on the account.

For example, the coarse-grained entitlement `Storage` grants access to all
storage related functions, such as `save` and `load`, which save a value to storage,
and load a value from storage respectively.

The fine-grained entitlement `AddKey` for instance,
grants access to only the `add` function of the `Account.Keys` value,
that is, it grants access to adding a key to the account.

An authorized account reference like `auth(Storage, AddKey) &Account`
therefore provides read access, as well as write access to storage,
and the ability to add a new key to that account.

[Signed transactions](../transactions.md) can get authorized account references
for each signer of the transaction that signs as an authorizer.
The `prepare` phase of the transaction can specify exactly which entitlements
it needs to perform its work.

For example, a transaction that deploys a contract to an account can be written as follows:

```cadence
transaction {
    prepare(signer: auth(AddContract) &Account) {
        signer.contracts.add(name: "MyContract", code: [/* code */])
    }
}
```

Here, the transaction requests an authorized reference with the `AddContract` entitlement.
That means that the transaction is entitled to add a contract to the account,
but is not able to add another key to the account, for example.

Script can get any kind of access to any account, using the built-in `getAuthAccount` function:

```cadence
fun getAuthAccount<T: &Account>(_ address: Address): T
```

This function is only available in scripts.
Though scripts can perform write operations,
they discard their changes upon completion.
Attempting to use this function outside of a script,
for example in a transaction,
causes a type error.

## Creating an account

The `Account` constructor allows creating new accounts.
The function requires a reference to a _payer_ account,
which should pay for the account creation.

The payer account must have enough funds to be able to create an account.
If the account does not have the required funds, the program aborts.

The constructor returns a reference to the new account
which has all coarse-grained account entitlements
(it has the type `auth(Storage, Contracts, Keys, Inbox, Capabilities) &Account`).
This provides write access to all parts fo the new account,
for example, storage, contracts, and keys.

```cadence
fun Account(payer: auth(BorrowValue | Storage) &Account):
	auth(Storage, Contracts, Keys, Inbox, Capabilities) &Account
```

For example, the following transaction creates a new account
and has the signer of the transaction pay for it:

```cadence
transaction {
    prepare(signer: auth(BorrowValue) &Account) {
        let account = Account(payer: signer)
    }
}
```
