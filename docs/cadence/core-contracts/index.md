title: Flow Core Contracts
description: The smart contracts that power the Flow protocol
---

Flow relies on a set of core contracts that define key portions of the
Flow protocol.

These contracts control the following:

- Standard fungible token behavior
- Default token behavior ([FlowToken](./flow-token.mdx))
- Account, transaction and storage fee payments
- Staking and delegation ([FlowIDTableStaking](./staking-contract-reference.mdx))
- Token lock-ups ([LockedTokens](./locked-tokens.mdx))
